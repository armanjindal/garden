They're inherently exploratory ‚Äì notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.\n\nWhile this is a good starting point, I find the metaphor of \"garden\" is much richer.\n\nGardens are, primordially, a place of *creation*. Unlike blogs which are comprised of distinct, complete, static, and organized entities, gardens are comprised of a growing network of living entities that are responding to the environment. Like the act of gardening, writing is radically incremental one. **It isn't heroic or final.**  One is never *done* working on their garden. That would be ridiculous. \n\nIt is my hope to create something that is *alive*. The best gardens have \"life.\" (TODO: Add reference to the timeless way of building). Call it vibes, a feeling, energy, juju: it is that intangible but real feeling we get from certain  places, people things. \"Life\" emerges at an untraceable point in the development of a system. Interestingly its presence isn't always recognized, but its absence is. \n\nTo be clear, I know there isn't much of that here *yet*. This is early. Most of my pieces are *saplings.* Expect some typos, incomplete sentences, and notes with little structure. The writing here isn't my considered \"final\" opinion. In fact, I expect over the course of my life, most pages will die. This is good. \n\nIdeas are helpful insofar as they lead to **life**: action, community, flourishing, and further questions. \"Bad ideas\" are anything that distracts the energy and attention that the best ideas demand. In this context, I am the measure of\"good\" and \"bad\" and much like myself, I am only sure that it will change over time. Exposing my thoughts on the page as clearly as possible will help me test theory against *reality*, unafraid to modify, discard, and eradicate the bad.\n\nI haven't started this garden to be *right*. It is an elaborate forcing mechanism to work in public, build a second brain, and write.  It's a long-term project to reap the compounding benefits of knowledge, form and find community, and a platform to express myself with greater control of the medium than social media. \n\nThrough consistent *gardening*, I hope to plant a few solid trees, nourished by the sunlight and the scrutiny of my readers. In the face of the confusing, contingent, and cruelly indifferent world, I believe that Voltaire offers a compelling response in the pithy concluding line of *Candide*: \n\n\u003e [ \"Il faut cultiver notre jardin.\"](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/)  ‚Äî Voltaire\n\nThis garden ‚Äî¬†the few thoughts, ideas, books, and media I've decided to care about ‚Äî¬†is my response to an overwhelming infinity of information, suffering, and possibility.\n\nIts my earnest love letter to ideas to a limit embracing life, that *perfect is the enemy of the good*, the, *[unreasonable effectiveness of showing up every day](https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/)*, and the approach to creativity that begins with unabashed unoriginal work by [stealing like an artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_Like_an_Artist). It is a living polemic against finality. Cultivating this garden is an affirmation of my limited agency, and through it I seek to share what I find beautiful, inspiring, and interesting with people in my life. \n\nThe writing here, the plants growing in this garden, are not isolated, but neither are they neatly connected. They exist rooted in soil, connect by by a rhizome ‚Äî a tangled mass of subterranean  roots. My goal is to make connections between writing as explicit as possible: tracing the genealogy, connections, and changes to my writing over time is quite selfishly a fascinating project of self-examination.\n\nTo support this lofty goal, I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack to build this site. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî a [power user native](digital-garden/Independent%20Study/Power%20\u0026%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md), personal knowledge management note editor with a graph view displaying the 'links' between pages. I publish this site using an open source built by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) called [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz#quartz) which compiles my local Obsidian vault into a Hugo site. All the pages are in `markdown` and versioned on GitHub, so there is a permanent, timestamped, line-by-line record of every change. I hope to look back at the commit histories to understand how my thinking changes. These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts, which ultimately help me shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation. \n\n\n## üöÄ Community \nAlthough I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its \"life.\"  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use it to write. \n\nRight now, there are two ways:\n1. Feedback. You often need to review the code to merge a development branch into the main branch. This functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. \n2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I aim to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write. \n3. (TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel. \n\nRight now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it to \"cultivate my garden\" best I can. ü™¥\n\n\n## üßê [Who Am I?](https://youtu.be/fR5-x7v7UkE?t=37) \n\nMy name is Arman Jindal. I was born in Los Angeles, USA in the last month of millenia and moved to Pune, India, when I was seven. I was educated in Pune, in the International Baccalaureate (IB), until I moved to New York for college in 2018. I am in the final semester of my undergraduate at Columbia College, studying a combination track of Computer Science (CS) \u0026 Philosophy. I built my major through the CS department, joining several classes from philosophy, computer science, formal linguistics, and the history of science and technology, around the theme which I have retroactively come to understand as the relationship between [Language \u0026 Computation](work-in-progress/College%20-%20Language%20\u0026%20Computation.md). I modified my major (much to the annoyance but kindness of my academic advisor) semester since junior year in response to changing interests and to take the best classes professors were offering that semester. \n\nI work as a Peer Writing Fellow at the [Columbia University Writing Center](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/node/4083), where I work one-on-one in hour long sessions with writers from the Columbia community. Working on a single piece of writing, we try to help move writers to the next stage in their writing process and develop them as writers using research-based methods. I am not an authority but an attentive and curious reader. I am amazed by the incredible work of my peers and am thrilled to be a small part of bringing their ideas to life. Finding [the right words](digital-garden/Jugaad%20and%20the%20Power%20of%20the%20Right%20Word.md) to express yourself is both empowering and world shaping. Being a part of this incredible community of writers and teachers is one of the highlights of my undergraduate experience (shout out to the best bosses: [Sue Mendelsohn](https://english.columbia.edu/content/sue-mendelsohn) and [Jason Ueda](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/uwp/writing-center/consultants#JasonU)and my incredible friend, who introduced me to this world [Isabelle Pride](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellepride/)).\n\nI graduate in May of 2023. I am looking to build technology with incredible people who value learning, writing, empowering its users, and growth. We have a social and moral obligation to shape technology so as to increase user agency rather than diminish it.  Professionally, I value \"People, Ideas, and Things\" in that order. I worked as a software engineer at [Airy](https://airy.co/), an open-source Berlin-based company, over the summer of 2022.

The mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible. \n\u003e ‚Äî Oscar Wilde, in a letter\n\nThe provocative title of Susan Sontag‚Äôs essay [*Against Interpretation*](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54889e73e4b0a2c1f9891289/t/564b6702e4b022509140783b/1447782146111/Sontag-Against+Interpretation.pdf) stakes its central claim quite clearly. Sontag attacks a contemporary practice of interpretation that reduces and ‚Äútames‚Äù the artwork it interprets. The contemporary institution of interpretation breaks down art into neat, ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù pieces that fit an ideology such as ‚ÄúMarxism‚Äù, ‚ÄùFreudianism‚Äù, ‚ÄúAristotelianism ‚Äù,¬† (insert your¬† -ism of choice), etc. She claims a misguided focus on the content over the form causes this practice. In this essay, I argue that an epistemic bias toward reason over sense experience is more foundational. This ancient epistemic bias, which begins with Plato, \"violates art\" because it fundamentally misunderstands it. This bias not only explains Sontag's claim that ‚Äúthis philistinism of interpretation is more rife in literature than in any other art‚Äù¬† but also elucidates her excited positive concept of interpretation: what Sontag calls an ‚Äúerotics of art.‚Äù¬†\n  \nSontag begins by historicizing and criticizing the ‚Äúrules‚Äù of modern interpretation. She is not against all interpretations, as the provocative title may suggest, but specifically, the modern kind. Modern interpretation¬†aggressively ‚Äútames‚Äù the work it interprets. She claims, ‚Äúthe contemporary zeal, for the project of interpretation, is often prompted [...] by an open aggressiveness and contempt for appearances. The old style of interpretation was insistent but respectful[..]. The modern style of interpretation excavates, and as it excavates, destroys: it digs ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the text to find a sub-text that is the true one.‚Äù Sontag‚Äôs use of the phrase ‚Äúcontempt for appearances‚Äù evokes the appearance/reality distinction from Greek antiquity, from Plato, that echoes through the Western canon. This distinction privileges our uniquely human capacity to reason. Reason is how we access truth with a capital T ‚Äî real \"reality\" (i.e Plato's world of forms). According to this epistemology, senses experience is deceptive because it it is in the way of reality. Reason must not be fooled by mere appearance. Sontag criticizes this epistemology that has been smuggled into the interpretation of art. This ‚Äúcontempt for appearance‚Äù leads to the destruction of works by interpretation. Sontag's diction of ‚Äúexcavation‚Äù and ‚Äúdig‚Äù connotes destructive and aggressiveness and once again invokes the Platonic image of the Cave and the appearance/reality so famously associated with it. Fast forward to when Sontag was writing, after Nietzsche's [death of God](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/22827-god-is-dead-god-remains-dead-and-we-have-killed) and the [death of the Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author), interpreters, no longer inhibited by authorial intent or foundationalist truth, were happy to ‚Äúdig behind‚Äù the text to fit the literature into their preferred ideology. Sontag inverts the allegory of the Cave. Excessive reason chain art to the walls of the cave, reducing its power to a mere projection on the Cave wall. Rather than grant art the ability to unshackle us and change society, we shackle it and \"tame\" it with our interpretive practices. Embedded in this criticism is the claim that we must elevate sense experience over reason when interpreting art.¬†\n\nModern interpreters destroy works, according to Sontag, because of a misguided focus on content¬† ‚Äî a search for what the art says rather than a focus on form ‚Äî¬† how an artwork appears. While I agree with this idea, the content/form distinction is insufficient and problematic in its own way. The form and content of an artwork are not always easy to separate nor, as I will later argue, should be considered separately. Instead, our privileging of reason over sense experience leads us to focus on content because of a mistaken idea of how the parts of an artwork relate to the whole. Sontag gestures to this issue in an example of poor interpretation. ‚ÄúDirected to art, interpretation means plucking a set of elements (the X, the Y, the Z, and so forth) from the whole work. The task of interpretation is virtually one of translation. The interpreter says, Look, don‚Äôt you see that X is really - or really means - A?[...]‚Äù(3) In this example of poor interpretation, two distinct processes are taking place.¬†\n\n\n1. The breakdown of work into the parts \n\n2. Ascribing the parts meanings that are latent/hidden¬†\n\nThe second process, the attribution of hidden meanings is Sontag‚Äôs focus. It is the main thrust of her argument against interpretation. She argues we shouldn't do this to art. It is a translation that destroys the artwork. I completely agree. However, I believe the first, more foundational, process of breaking down an artwork into its parts, fundementally misunderstand what art is and its power over us. Exploring and criticizing this first process, can help convince us of Sontag's normative claim as well as understand her positive project better.   \n\nThe first process is the focus of the rest of this essay. It presents new philosophical problems: can we break down a work of art into its parts and recover the whole? If not, why? I claim, that the aesthetic use of language in literature cannot be broken down into its parts, analyzed as separate units, and built up to recover the whole. Once the language is used aesthetically, as in literature, the relationship of the parts to the whole changes. The power of this aesthetic use of language is in the immediate experience of the ‚Äúwhole‚Äù that is greater than the sum of parts. When language is used in a practical, non-literary context, the meaning of the whole is no more than the sum of its parts. The language used in everyday life often has to be broken down, analyzed sentence by sentence, and built back up. It is the confusion of these two distinct ways language is used that makes literature most susceptible to modern, aggressive interpretation.¬†\n\nAlthough Sontag still relies on the content/form distinction, she does criticize mereological reductionism (the idea that the whole is no more or less than its parts) in art. She says, ‚ÄúInterpretation, based on the highly dubious theory that a work of art is composed of items of content, violates art.‚Äù In breaking down a piece of art into its constituent parts of the content we ‚Äúviolate‚Äù it. But breaking it down into its form alone would do the same. It is not content/form that is the issue but the idea that we can and should break down art. For example, reading a chapter-by-chapter summary of Don Quixote would take away its power and literary quality. But so too would an interpretation that just spoke of the form (if such a thing was even possible). Imagine reading an interpretation that does not include plot points of the hilarious (mis)adventures of Knight Errant and his squire. Content and form are inseparable. We should stop trying to do the do this and develop a conceptual vocabulary that overcomes their opposition. However, a bias to reason explains why content is overemphasized. To reason about a complex whole, is to break it down into its tangible parts (either content or form but more often content), to reconstruct the whole takes away the intangible but real power art has. To sensually experience artwork is to confront it in as a whole ‚Äî content, and form in an instant.¬†\n\nBringing the focus back to literature the theory I have developed help explain why Sontag sees literature as an art form that is most poorly interpreted. Literature, unlike visual arts is consumed gradually. A painting has a high sense of immediacy that gives the viewer an immediate sense of the whole, unlike a novel. But once you are in the grasp of a literary work (which can take time and many times never happens) you find yourself experiencing the artwork as you are reading. This experience does not come from any one sentence but arises from the whole experience of the work that is expanding as you read on. These two uses of language interact since you are reading sentence by sentence, but the aesthetic quality emerges from no one sentence but all those that you have encountered so far. Because of this low sense of immediacy and the dual function o language, it is no wonder literature is, according to Sontag, most often subjected to the ‚Äúphilistinism of interpretation.‚Äù¬†¬†\n\nIn stark contrast to the artistic medium of¬† literature, Sontag points to the film as the ‚Äúmost alive,¬† the most exciting,¬† the most important of all art forms right now.‚Äù However, her explanation is unsatisfying as it relies exclusively on the content/form distinction. ‚Äú For the cinema, unlike the novel, possesses a¬† vocabulary of forms¬† -¬† the explicit, complex, and¬† discussable technology of camera movements, cutting, and composition of the frame that goes into the making of a film.‚Äù I do think there is an equally rich vocabulary of forms, from the crude ‚Äòliterary devices‚Äô high schoolers are taught to mine to the subtler description of narrative frames and compositions. It is rather superficial to claim that all one needs to do is develop a richer vocabulary of forms, and then the good interpretation will follow. Sontag does think that it is as simple as that, and I think understanding the issue as more foundationally a bias toward reason and misguided mereology better explains why a film with its more sense immediacy is not *as* irresponsibly interpreted as literture.  \n\nIn light of the analysis conducted so far,¬† I now focus on her positive practice of interpretation, what she calls ‚Äúcriticism‚Äù or ‚Äúerotics.‚Äù She says, ‚ÄúWe must learn to see more, hear more, feel more [...] The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than to show what it means. Sontag is appealing to the senses of sight and sound, as well as to the experience of our emotions. It is a clear call to use sense experience instead of more considered reason in the task of interpretation. To do this, we cannot approach art with contempt for appearance because the power of art lies in its appearance. This new mode of interpretation helps ‚Äúreveal the sensuous surface of the art‚Äù instead of smothering it with hidden meanings. The positive interpretation project is about enhancing our sensory and emotional experience and communicating it in our interpretations.¬†\n\nAt this point, one might worry that the emphasis on the sense experience of ‚Äúwholes‚Äù allows for crass relativism. That Sontag is open invitation for the affective fallacy in the interpretation of art. But in our experience of art, we are seldom the only ones to experience something. This plurality of feeling different people have when experiencing the same art can form a range of acceptable interpretations. These collective subjective experiences make the tasks of interpretation all the more fascinating. We can now evaluate an interpretation based on our experience of the works. If our artistic senses are attuned to what the interpreter tries to illuminate, they have succeeded in enhancing our experience of the work.¬† Therefore a better interpretation vs. a poor one comes to the ability of the interpreter to make those attune to the experience of the sensual surface of the work they are interpreting. Opening up interpretation to an ‚Äúerotics‚Äù by appealing to sense experience does increase the risk of relativism but does not necessarily have to lead to it. Sontag seems to gesture at a multiplicity of perspectives that can be evaluated, not objectively but collectively, on this idea that to ‚Äúreveal‚Äù an artwork is better than to ‚Äútame‚Äù it.¬†\n\nSontag‚Äôs criticism of the modern practice of interpretation illuminates foundational bias that has been smuggled into the practice that ‚Äúviolate art.‚Äù Through her analysis of what is lost in art and literature in this ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù misguided form of interpretation, I have argued that the content/form distinction is the product of the more foundational reason/sense experience bias.¬† This foundational bias reason uses content as the most obvious part and proceeds to break down an artwork into ‚Äúmaangable‚Äù pieces to find its hidden meaning. It is this process of breaking down art that most ‚Äúviolates it.‚Äù¬† From this framework, Sontag‚Äôs positive project of interpretation can be better understood. Only our immediate, sensory experience lends itself to fully capturing the effect of the parts working together as a whole.¬† In the case of literature, the constituent parts, namely language, cannot be broken down and analyzed as units as it is in everyday use. This dial function of language, as well as the low immediacy of the medium, are what make literature, more so than other art forms, more likely to be misread. By clarifying and recasting Sontag's argument in these terms, the positive project becomes more apparent. I hope that all readers and interpreters can actively build an institution of interpretation that celebrates the whole work‚Äî all its beauty, power, and perhaps most importantly, ability to ‚Äúmake us nervous‚Äù ‚Äî rather than to ‚Äútame‚Äù into its parts.**\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:33:43.818231414Z","tags":[]},"/digital-garden/Ibn-Tufayl":{"title":"The Primacy of the Physical in Ibn Tufayl's Philosophical Tale","content":"\nWhat is a human without society? To some, the question is nonsensical; to others, none is more important. Because, for the latter group, the isolated human in a ‚Äúthe state of nature,‚Äù give us access to *true human nature*. Writing in 12th century Islamic Spain, Ibn Tufayl considers this question in the allegorical and philosophical tale of Hayy Ibn YaqzƒÅn. This Islamic text, though largely ignored by Islamic world went on the inspire the later European philosophers, most famously Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau in their discussion of the state of nature. \n\nThe Tufayl chronicles the spiritual development of Hayy, a boy raised on by wolves, who through his own exploration reasons to (and beyond) the Qur‚Äôanic God reaching the height of Islamic spirituality: a meditative, ecstatic, Sufi-like, feeling of God. Tufayl directly contradicts Islam‚Äôs most prominent philosopher, Al-Ghazali by demonstrating the reason is sufficient to truly *feel* god. *In Deliverance from Error*, Al-Ghazali famously concludes that one must relinquish reason and take a leap of faith. This contradiction in the role of reason is often explored. \n\nHowever, an often overlooked aspect of the tale is the significance of the physical world for gaining knowledge. In this essay, I argue that Hayy's process of gaining knowledge, reasoning from the physical world to the soul and eventually to God, and his changing relationship with the physical world through this process show that Ibn Tufayl's religious worldview is humanistic and this-worldly. Ibn Tufayl, unlike Al-Ghazali, sees this life and the physical world, as ultimately worth affirming, not one to be endured. \n\nHayy's knowledge of God is based on knowledge of the physical world. Knowledge of the physical world underlines God since he defines God and the soul as that which is \"non-physical.\" The ‚Äúnon-physical‚Äù is not a mere description of God, but the definition of God. Hayy first makes distinguishes the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-physical‚Äù when his doe mother dies. Looking at her dead body, with her heart in his hands, Ibn Tufayl narrates Hayy reasoning, \"[f]rom that - and not from this lifeless body - all those actions had issued. The body was simply a tool of this being, like the stick with which he fought the animals\" (Ibn Tufayl, pg. 115). Hayy reasons that his mothers identity must have once been in \"that,\" which he is holding ‚Äî her heart. He sees \"that\" as the driver of the body and the source of her \"true\" identity. The ‚Äúphysical‚Äù was ‚Äúsimply a tool‚Äù of the non-physical. Hayy reasons by analogy. Just as the stick is the \"tool\" he used to fend off animals, the body is the tool for \"that.\" This process of observation of the physical world and reasoning about it is his method of gaining knowledge about God. After realizing the importance of the physical world for knowledge of the non-physical, Hayy turns to dissecting and studying the animals around him. The knowledge he gains after years of studying animal behavior and anatomy helps him clarify what he called \"that,\" his mother's \"true\" identity, into the concept of the \"soul.\" He comes to see all living beings as \"compounded out of the corporeal factor and another, non-physical factor [...]. He dropped the physical and his mind fastened on the other factor, which is called simply the soul.\" (Ibn Tufayl, pg 124) Living things are a mixture of physical and non-physical factors. The soul ‚Äî defined as the ‚Äúnon-physical‚Äù ‚Äî uses the body ‚Äî the ‚Äúphysical.‚Äù This relationship of utility between the binary ‚Äúphysical‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-physical‚Äù is a central idea he develops in his spiritual progress. The definition of God, which is based on the negative emphasis (non-physical) shows that knowledge of God is in the physical world. Ibn Tufayl imbues this world and knowledge of it with divine importance since only by studying it do we come to learn about God.   \n\nHayy‚Äôs dual concept of the self ‚Äî the idea that we are a combination of the physical and non-physical ‚Äî forms the hierarchy of his morality. The higher, \"non-physical\" is associated with the nobility and the \"physical\", although it is not characterized as inherently evil, is seen as the ‚Äúlower‚Äù ‚Äúanimal‚Äù part of himself. From this hierarchy, Hayy infers a moral obligation to study and cultivate the ‚Äúnon-physical‚Äù and therefore emulate God, whom Hayy importantly refers to in this passage using the capitalized, Qur'anic pronoun \"Him.\"  \n\n\"... Hayy saw that his nobler part, by which he knew the Necessarily Existent, bore some resemblance to Him as well. For like Him it transcended the physical. Thus another obligation was to endeavor, in whatever way possible to attain His attributes [...] and remold his character to His [....]. He recognized, however, that he was like the lesser animals in his lower half, the body for it belonged to the world of generation and decay. [...]Still, he knew that this body had not been created for him idly. It had not been linked with him for nothing. He must care for it and preserve it, even though in do in so doing he would do no more than any animal. \"(Ibn Tufayl, pg 142)\n \nHayy ‚Äúnobler parts‚Äù refers to his capacity to reason. To emphasize that Hayy is reasoning to God,  the term \"the Necessarily Existent\" with capitalization refer to God. As Hayy realizes that a part of him ‚Äî specifically that capacity to reason ‚Äî he must now try to be like God. At this point in the passage, Ibn Tufayl switches from calling God \"Necessarily Existent\" to the capitalized \"Him\". Ibn Tufayl makes this decision because it shows a correspondence between \"him\" (Hayy) and \"Him\" (God). The syntactic similarity between \"him\" and \"Him\" helps convey the point. Hayy derives a moral obligation is to become like God, in \"whatever way possible.\" To turn the lowercase h into an uppercase H. As humans, there is a \"part\" of us that is like God ‚Äî namely our reason. Hayy must \"remold\" his ‚Äúlower part‚Äù according to his ‚Äúhigher‚Äù one. The word \"remold\" rather than a more destructive term, as used by the Sufis, like \"annihilate\" implies an acceptance/integration of the self rather than a destruction of oneself. Ibn Tufayl sees the self as a mixture of the physical body and the soul ‚Äî the \"physical\" and \"non-physical\", or the animal and the God. At no point does Ibn Tufayl tell us to reject the physical. Hayy's body is not to be mortified or hated. Yes, it is lower than his \"nobler parts\", but it is a part he must accept as a responsibility to \"care for\" and ‚Äúremold.‚Äù His body, a symbol of his connection to the physical world, has as a purpose. It was \"linked\" to him for a reason, namely to, \"remold\" it according to his ‚Äúhigher‚Äù self.\n\nOne way to see Hayy's spiritual progress is his use of the physical world as a \"tool\" for progressively \"higher\" ends. Hayy always used the physical world, but what changes as he develops spiritually is his reason why. In the first quarter of his life, Hayy realizes that \"despite his lack of natural weapons, he could manufacture everything he wanted to make up for the lack\" (Ibn Tufayl, pg 118). Hayy is superior to all other animals because of the tools he makes for protection, shelter, hunting, etc. However, his ‚Äúuse‚Äù of reason is for the same end as the animals. After the death of his mother and the beginning of his exploration of the soul, Hayy dissects animals to gain knowledge of the \"physical world\" and \"non-physical world.\" He now uses the physical world to gain knowledge, a uniquely human pursuit, guided by reason, and therefore a \"nobler\" end than mere survival and material comfort. Finally, in his last stage before a peak experience of God, his \"use\" of the physical world is purely for material sustenance to \"resemble\" God. Ibn Tufayl narrates, \"Hayy knew that his supreme goal was this third form of mimesis [of God]; but this would not be his without a long stint of training and self-discipline through the second, and this itself would not hold up for long if he neglected the first.\" (Ibn Tufayl, pg. 143) The second form of mimesis is a reference to the celestial bodies, and first to \"inarticulate animals.\" (Ibn Tufayl, pg. 142) Ibn Tufayl constructs a tri-level pyramid. At the base of the pyramid are physical necessities like food and shelter. As he progresses up the pyramid, the reason for using the \"physical world\" changes but remains necessary. still is needed.  At the highest for of mimesis, the physical world is used only to sustain Hayy's body. Ibn Tufayl's refusal to neglect the \"base\" materiality of human identity emphasizes its importance in peak religious experience in a way that is radical. Humans are a mixture of \"Himself\" (God) and the animal, and we must accept all of ourselves.  From survival to knowledge, and finally mimesis of God, we are inescapably reliant on the ‚Äúphysical world.‚Äù We do not have to destroy this ‚Äúanimal‚Äù part of ourselves use it and \"remold it\" for our highest purpose ‚Äî the emulation of God. \n \nAt this point, one might object that I have overstated the significance of the physical world. An alternative explanation for the continual references to physicality is to avoid plot holes in the story, and therefore the \"physical\" is not as philosophically significant as I have argued. However, this text, the story, and philosophy work together. Ibn Tufayl's peculiar choice of medium, a philosophical tale, emphasizes that the plot is deeply intertwined with his underlying philosophy. Hayy's isolation from society means he does not have access to the Qur'an or any textual, communitarian aspects of Islam. For the Islamic tradition where the foundational text is the unequivocal word of God, this is radical. However, equally significant, Ibn Tufayl‚Äôs choice to put Hayy on an island burgeoning with life brings him closer to nature in a way society does not allow. Civilization separates us from nature and the \"physical world.\" Humans are removed from contending with other animals and from the harshness of the natural world. We no longer need to fight for our safety in the way Hayy has to. It is the combination of the lack of scripture and society, as well as the proximity and harshness of the physical world, that leaves Hayy with only two things ‚Äî his reason and nature. Faith in scripture is no longer an option, and neither is the material protection from nature by society. So when Hayy perfectly understands the God of the Qur'an as confirmed by Absal, and describes an ecstatic experience with God similar to that of the Sufis and Al-Ghazali, it is both brilliant and radical.\n\nThe consequences of the primacy of the physical in Hayy Ibn YaqzƒÅn illuminate a radical difference in Ibn Tufayl's and Ghazali's religious worldview. While they describe similar experiences of God and agree on the societal importance of the Qur'an, for Ibn Tufayl it is not the annihilation of the self, but a subordination of the physical body to the Godly \"true\" self that leads to ultimate spiritual salvation.  When we use all the tools at our disposal ‚Äî reason and the physical world ‚Äî for the singular purposes of mimesis we feel God. Reason is sufficient and the physical world is a tool not an obstacle on the way to salvation. Al-Ghazali and the Sufi see the \"physical\" more antagonistically. While one can achieve ecstatic union with God, the body is in the way, and therefore, self-mortification and severe asceticism are often practiced. Their worldview, in contrast to Ibn Tufayl's, is other-worldly. Life, under their worldview, should only be endured until the Day of Judgement. The ecstatic experience of God is a respite from this-world. Whereas for Ibn Tufayl the world and all of its beings have a spark of God emanating from them. There is a harmony that is possible between the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-physical.‚Äù At his peak, Hayy is not a physical and non-physical being but experiencing the unity of purposes in himself and in this world. He does this by integrating and subordinating the physical self to the true, transcendent, and ‚Äúnon-physical‚Äù self. Whereas the Sufi path is shrouded in mysticism and faith, Hayy's path is based entirely on the universal human of reason grounded in experience of the physical world. It is not easy to figure out, but the Qur‚Äôanic understanding of God is accessible in nature and human nature. Ibn Tufayl is not critical of Qur‚Äôan in any way, but through the tale of Hayy Ibn YaqzƒÅn shows that it is not absolutely necessary. It is possible to reason to an experience of God in a ‚Äòstate of nature.‚Äô This possibility has radical implications for Islamic spirituality. \n\nIbn Tufayl‚Äôs Hayy Ibn YaqzƒÅn is an allegorical and philosophical tale that emphasizes the primacy of physicality. Hayy's knowledge of God and the soul is based on knowledge of the \"physical.\" Hayy \"uses\" the physical world to accomplish increasingly spiritual ends and comes to see his animal, physical self as a necessary responsibility and part of his identity. In emphasizing the primacy of the physical, Ibn Tufayl put the whole human, their mixed identity and place in the natural world, at the forefront of his religious worldview. He sees the physical world as the basis for knowledge of God. Humans are a unique species with a Godlike capacity to reason. When the highest form of reason ‚Äî the mimesis of God ‚Äî uses the physical world and body for this sole purpose, one reaches the height of Islamic spirituality. For these reasons, Ibn Tufayl's religious worldview is humanistic and focused on this world. One does not need to annihilate oneself or parts of oneself for intimacy with God. Hayy's God is consistent with the God of the Qur'an. Still, in telling this story, Ibn Tufayl presents a compelling, rational case for a God, a mixed self, and a path to reach him, which all thinkers, regardless of faith or religion, will continue to wrestle with across centuries and civilizations. \n\nReferences\n Ibn Tufayl's Hayy Ibn Yaqzan, tr.

From graphic designers integrating their IPads into their *Photoshop* workflow to first-year investment bankers analysts using macros to automate their tedious work in *Excel*, power users span technologies and a range of technical skills. Like the craftsman whose tools are well-worn, power users use technology in this way. As a tool for the most mundane to the most creative ends. Power users contrast what I will come to define as \"passive users.\" \n\nPower use is a term that characterizes a way of *using* technology. They are nothing new. Arguably they are the first users of any technology, particularly of the early personal computer and the internet, because you *had* to know how to get the most out of your system to do anything remotely useful. Use of the term, as we understand it today, peaked in 1990 and has since been declining, according to Google Ngram.[^1] However, this understudied *use* of technology is not a relic of the past or a trivial fad. Power users are resurging in exciting and meaningful ways.\n\nIn this study, I aim to understand, locate, and clearly describe the \"power\" these users have that distinguishes them from other technology users. In the first section, I situate them historically and develop concepts we will use later. Starting with the free software\" geeks\" early 90s Christopher Kelty in *Two Bits: The Cultural Significance of Free Software* often associated with \"Web 1.0\", then hackers of the mid-90s to late 2010s studied by Gabriella Coleman, and finally, more contemporary users of\"Web 2.0\" such as Instagram, Tik Tok, and Spotify relying on scholarship by Finn Bruton *SPAM: A Shadow History of the Internet* (2014) and Nick Seaver's *Computing Taste: Algorithms and the Makers of Music Recommendation.* (2022). I use these different kinds of users to draw out relevant distinctions and similarities they have with Power User to argue for the need to conceive of them as distinct and help explore the implications of this kind of use. Understanding the power of this user not only helps to understand the history and future of computing and technology but can also help develop normative standards to understand our increasing reliance on technologies to form identity, express ourselves and form community, online. \n\nThis approach focused on use is informed by Matthew Allen's claim that a better way to do the history of the internet and technology is in a discourse of *use* rather than one *version*. I use Web 1.0/2.0/3.0 reluctantly because, as Allen convincingly argues in (FIND ARTICLE), the versions are contested, revisionist, and often the product of marketing. Which aspects of the \"Web\" remain continuous and which change between versions depends on what story you are trying to tell. As such, I only use them insofar as they help me explain a particular kind of *use*. Once we have pinned down the use, I will refer to that use and user group  ‚Äî not to the \"version\" of the \"Web\" we take to symbolize a particular kind of use. \n\nAs we increasingly rely on and become more competent in specific technologies for work, life, and creative expression, producers recognize that some users might want to modify and extend their tools to do things creators didn't anticipate. There is a rising technology, in particular software applications, that are designed to encourage precisely this. I will refer to these as \"power user technology.\" \n\nA distinct and relevant distinct feature of power users, both software and community, is the unique way complexity is managed. Power users also do not necessarily need to be able to \"code,\" although many might learn if they need. Their desire to get technical or into the infrastructure is secondary to a higher-order goal. Namely, they are task-focused rather than tech focused. Instead of seeking to understand the internals of their tool, they are interested in learning enough about it to use it better. As such, power users benefit from an anchor in a sea of complexity. This might seem trivial, but it's strategy developers often use when learning a codebase. This approach to complexity is supported and cultivated by power user native software and communities of power users. I will develop throughout this study. \n\nThe second section aims to clarify the concepts of a power user and a power user native technology by grounding it in a concrete example of a \"power user technology.\"  \n\nThe second section is centered on a case study of personal knowledge management (PKM), note-taking software called *Obsidian*. Obsidian is designed to encourage power use. It is an illustrative example of a *power user native technology*. Obsidian has a vibrant community, quick forum support, a burgeoning ecosystem of plug-ins, and lots of user-generated educational material,  even though it is primarily built and maintained by two developers. Obsidian has a unique user base within a crowded field of PKM and note taking. Obsidian then distinguishes itself from its competitors, such as Notion, OneNote, and Evernote, by appealing more to power users. It does this by offering key features that appeal to a user more likely to become power users, such as a local first markdown file format and exposing a framework and API to build and use plug-ins easily. \n\nMethodologically I will rely on my experience as an early user and my use of it for . During the course of the study I will create a plug-in and interact with the power user community through the [forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JVv55gu6?utm_source=Discord%20Widget\u0026utm_medium=Connect) channels. By actively participating in the community and getting a sense of what it is and isn't, I plan to avoid compelling theories detatched from reality.\n\nThe end of this section will review some of the claims of the identity-forming capacity of technology in light of this case study. I will write about the impact on digital identity formation and community finding of Obsidian power users who demonstrate agency and understand themselves as able to shape the technology. Finally, I end this section by contrasting Obsidian's (a company of less than five people) technology and community of users with Notion, a more popular note-taking app with over 400 employees. Discussing the ways, both companies have benefited from catering and creating \"power users.\"\n\nIn the third section, I will compare the subjectivity formed through \"power use\" to that formed through \"passive\" use. I begin by reconstructing the conditions of what Nick Seaver calls the 'Subjectivity Bewilderment' and understanding the community (or lack thereof) of \"passive users\" in terms of Finn Brunton's idea of the \"reactive public.\"  Passive users, constructed and reinforced by specific technologies, cultivate an overwhelmed and defeatist response to complexity. Users have to trust and rely heavily on the technology they use to, in the words of Steve Jobs, \"just work.\" They are forced to trust the \"black box\" recommendation algorithms that drive their experience and never to question its constraints or the interface and technology of self-expression. Rather they buy into defeatist, bewildered responses to complexity. Technology, in their view, couldn't be any other way. \n\nIn contrast, I argue that power user native software creates a 'Subjectivity of Creativity.' Power users are all about negotiating complexity with their producers. Producers don't unnecessarily expose complexity that doesn't help their users build or modify. Transmitting and sharing knowledge occurs naturally within a community brought together by this shared set of values. Finally, power users understand themselves as able to shape the technology they use and rely on both individually and collectively. Combined, these three are fundamentally different responses to complexity than bewilderment and overwhelm. Power users represent a use of technology that creates a subjectivity that sees itself as able to shape the world through a structured response to complexity.  I believe that this Creative subjectivity, one of agency and structure in response to complexity, is at once similar to that of the \"geeks\" but overcomes the limitations of the \"recursive public.\" At once, preserving some of the early internet utopia visions while explaining its failure to manifest. Power users provide a compelling vision of use which we strive toward that is realistic and already underway. Technology, through their actions and community, is viewed as contingent. Users feel agency, regardless of technicality. \n\nOne of the most important is the degree to which the passive user and power user the degree they aware of their use and community. Power user, while not as reflexivley aware as hackers and geeks, are aware of the limitations of expression and of themselves as a community. Produer of passive users (which is the samee as producers of technologies that encourage passive users) rely on re-enforcing a sense in which it couldn't be any other way. They have a vested interest in obfuscating the power dynamics of their user/producer relations. Passive users lack any sense of agency in shaping the technology (\"sure I hate the algorithm, but I can't get off Instagram\") and any awarness of a community as such their subjectivity is formed without any awarness. The normative implications of this are immense. \n\nScholarship that examines how media use shapes the identity and self-understanding of its subjects, especially new media studies, is notorious for being vague and hand-wavey. Methodologically, although this is the most conceptual of the three sections bordering on the philosophical, my claims will be based on a mix of compelling history, sociology, and anthropological scholarship on technology and grounded in the real world with the case study on Obsidian. This section aims to synthesize much of the conceptual work of the first and fieldwork of the section to substantively unpack and understand the normative implications of the power use of technology. We can then apply the lens of this concept, to name what certain GenAI companies are doing and not doing. We can point to direct things that producers do and do not do, \n\n- Power-user - We all have the right to **comment**. \n\n## Outline \n\n\u003e[!WARN]\n\u003e This is under development and will be changing as I read more. For a sense of timeline and road map you can see [Process Document - Power Users](digital-garden/Independent%20Study/Process%20Document%20-%20Power%20Users.md)\n\n### **Section I: Power Use in History**\n\nIn the first section, I aim to develop concepts and analysis centered around three distinct aspects of Power Users by situating them in the history of computer and internet use. Specifically, by comparing power users with:\n1. Freesoftware \"geeks.\" \n2. Hackers.\n3. \"Web 2.0\"\n\t- Content-Creators\n\t- Passive Users\n\n#### 1.1 User/Producer Relationship: \n\nPower users and power-use native producers have a unique relationship. Producers recognize they do not need to nor can they fully anticipate how users might use their technology. It is an ongoing negotiation and experiment as users ask for additional functionality and producers consider if they should allow it.\n\nAt the same time, they do not want to give them access to the source code necessarily. Not only because of issues with monetizing open source but also because their users don't need it. Producers manage the complexity for users, exposing only useful API endpoints and ways to string together commands. This manifests in many ways, often as plug-in architectures, macro programming, custom keybindings etc.  \n\nUnlike hackers whose adversarial relationship with the software they are \"hacking,\" power users are in constant dialog and cooperation with the producers of the technology they power use. \n\n### 1.2 Tool First, Purpose Driven\n\nPower users clearly understand their technology as a tool. \n\nThere is deeper truth expressed when we might say power users know the \"ins and outs\" of their tools. They often know how to pipe in inputs and pipe out outputs from their tool. In this way power users often stich together tools together. Capturing some of the early UNIX philosophy. \n\n#### 1.3 Collaboration \u0026 Community: \n\nA common feature of power user native software is active discussion forums. They often form communities to support one another as they learn the technology. A vibrant community of power users often creates educational content and contributes plug-ins. Running code is a form of argumentation. In this way, strong communities of power users are similar to the \"recursive publics\" of the freesoftware \"geeks.\"\n\nHowever, unlike them, they are immediately concerned with the infrastrastructure as much as they are with the tool itself. Also their knowledge and use of the \n\n\n#### 1.3 Identity \u0026 Agency:\n\nAs a result power users feel a sense of agency in shaping technology for their use by negotiating with its producers (1.1). At the same time there is a structured response to complexity, and community that general transmits knowledge. (1.2 \u0026 1.3)\n\nPower user are more intimatley aware of the limitations of the technology they use. As such, they are more aware of the impact on their indentity. \n\nPassive users, view technology as necessary and not contingent. \n\n\n## Section II: Case Study - Obsidian \u0026 Power User Software\n\nThe goal of this section is to ground the conceptual analysis done in the first section and to focus more on the producer side of the history. \n\nOne of the most distinct and interesting aspects of power users is power user native technologies.

Often seen as unquestionably 'good.' Participation spread. Mill viewed participation as a \"school of democracy,\" and Lincoln codified it in the democracy of the late nineteenth century with his \"of the people, by the people and for the people.\" There was an outward expansion of participation as a value in the workforce and Church in the 20th century. \n\nSimilar to how Finn Brunton understands \"community\" in his counter-history of the internet (SPAM), Kelty looks at participation as a problem. He writes:\n\n\u003e \"Participation is not, in my argument, a universal idea that represents specific material practices or one that animates them in some structured way. **It is a problem**. Something is a problem when people start to think about it as uncertain, difficult, unfamiliar, or broken. \" (Paticipant Introduced,pg 37) \n\n\nThe problem of participation isn't new. In fact, Kelty reverses the sequence of ideas, breaking with a \"political theory tradition in which participation plays only a bit part in the great historical drama of democracy.\" (pg 42) He claims that viewing \"participation as a longstanding problem between relations between persons and collectives\" where the \n\n\"The apparatus we call 'liberal representitive democracy' is one concrete response to the problem of participation.\" (pg 42.)\n\n* This reversal of sequence is a point Kelty makes in his earlier work on the Cultural Significance of Free Software. Where he notices that the experience of participating in \nThe idea of digital participation offers tangible fuel to the cultural imagination, to the vision of 'direct democracy'. Kelty, who studied a manifestation of digital participation in his book the Cultural Significance of Free Software. \n\nThe discourse of Use is a different lens than that of participation. Use is focused on the product that comes from technologies, and how that process of creation is both world and subject-shaping.\n\n* Democray \u0026 Participation\n\t* Decentralized\n\n'\"In the 1960s, such bureaucrats and technical experts represented a broken form of democracy - one that relied on expert judgements, couched in a inaccesible jargon authorized by the prestige of engineering, mathematics and scientific management. Politics has been captured by these men, and the movements of the 1960s saw it as a necessary countermovement to liberate government from the elites and experts, and return it to a decentralized, face-to-face politics of the local.\"'\n\n\"The image of expertise has haunted the notion of participation ever since ‚Äî and the stories I tell about 'formatting' of participation in the twentieth century track how the desire to return governance to the people through participation has often ended up creating new versions of the monsters it sought to defeat: proceduralized and (ironically) expert-led forms of 'engagment' and direct citizen involvement. \"\n\n\n## Participant, Experienced \n\n\"A richer concept of participation will be of use in explaining how participation today should be considered not only as a concept or as a procedure, but also an experience\" (pg54)\n\n\n## Participant, Employed\n\"The story of workplace participation is also one story o the development of contributory autonomy: the replacement of individuals whose personhood is a feature of the groups they experience with individuals whose personhood is expected to create those collectives through contribution.\" (pg 96)","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:33:43.834231836Z","tags":[]},"/digital-garden/Independent-Study/book-notes/Three-Ethical-Moments-in-Debian":{"title":"Three Ethical Moments in Debian","content":"\nOngoing notes on [Gabriella (Biella) Coleman's](https://gabriellacoleman.org/) dissertation on the dynamic ethical and motives of Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) developers through a case study of Debian.\n\nIn conversation with [The Participant](The%20Participant.md) for my independent study on [Power \u0026 Power User - Prospectus](digital-garden/Independent%20Study/Power%20\u0026%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md)Part One: Debian and its Social Organization:\n\n\u003e \"While the Berkley Unix gurus accepted contributions from those who were not already participating on the project, it was difficult to pierce the inner circle of authority and become an actual member of the team. This, from the point of view of the developers participating in the \\[Debian] round-table, produced an unacceptable form of project participation, characterized by a degraded elitism that failed to equalize the terrain on which developers could prove their worth. As I discuss elsewhere (Coleman 2005), the F/OSS hacker system of meritocracy compels individuals to release the fruits of their labor in order to constantly equalize the conditions for production so that others can engage in the life-long project of technical self-cultivation within a community of peers. \"\n\u003e ‚Äî Page 13\n\n- Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, was able to uniquely \"harness the power of individuality to produce a distribution that far exceeded the contributions of any single person.\" (pg 13)\n\nFormatting Participation - How do we scale participation? \n- New Maintainers Process - also includes a process of educating and shaping their moral sensibilities through their participation. \n- Takes several months including a sponsor who acts as an adovcate. \n1.

Some questions are standard others application manager dependent. Universally seen as \"good\" (whereas some of the technical stuff is seen is absurd.)\n\n\"What we see here with these NM narratives is what Robert Cover, in his discussion of a *nomos,* describes as a simultaneous process of subjective commitment to and objective projective of norms, a bridging that emerges out of a narrative mode: 'This objectification of the norms to which ones is committed frequently,' Cover writes, 'perhaps always entails a narrative ‚Äî a story of how the low, now object, ame to be, and more importantly, *how it came to be one's own.*'\"\n\n‚Äî page 39\n\n\"These narratives are at the basis of temporal movement and personal transformation. They take people to new locations, and past, present, and future come together in a moment of ethical assesent. The past is weaved into the present, and the voicing of commitment in the application becomes the path toward a future within the project. It is a step that brings a developer closer to a new social localization within a larger ethical and technical project of developers wh have undergone to same reflective exercise. \n\n‚Äî page 40 \n\n-  Undergoing this reflective excercise is one of the steps needed to be able to partcipate in this community.

Not Momentum","content":"\nMomentum measures how hard it is to stop something once it is in motion. The metaphor of momentum is used (and abused!) everywhere, from sports and entrepreneurship to habit formation and relationships. Momentum has gone from a descriptive physical quantity to a pervasive mental model we use to conceptualize ourselves in the world. \n\nI've always had a toxic relationship with momentum. Momentum can work for you as much as it can against you. To quote a Nike commercial that used to be my alarm clock at a particularly \"grindset\" moment in my past life as an athlete, [\"momentum is a cruel mistress. It will turn on you in a dime.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmkNKEHC8Pg)\n\nWhen you've got \"momentum,\" you feel invincible. The \"weight\" of the previous productive days or previous workouts helps \"push\" you through the one in front of you. The feeling of momentum often comes with improvement. Don't break the streak is a powerful motivator. When you've got it, it feels great. At one point, I used to equate momentum with success. \n\nThe other side, however, is equally cruel. Because eventually, life happens. A family trip \"gets in the way\" of your workout program. You've had a massive cheat meal on a night out with friends. You've lost \"momentum.\" All the \"weight\" you once had working for you is now gone. You've lost something that isn't tangible but feels very real. This feeling has often led me into a destructive, unproductive spiral. I know I'm not the only one who feels the effect of this metaphor.\n\n\"Momentum\" evokes the image of a rock rolling down the mountain. It **requires immense effort** to start. As the rock accelerates down the mountain, you better get out of the way. Momentum is a vector, meaning it has a magnitude and direction. It is always \"going\" somewhere.\n\nNow, metaphors are never perfect. But I've got a better one. *Rhythm*. \n\nEveryone needs to find their own, and this can change with time. Losing your rhythm is quite different from losing your momentum. As an overly enthusiastic [beginner modern dancer](digital-garden/Meditations%20on%20Modern%20Dance.md), I know you can recover it as quickly as you lost it. The best way to do that is the get back to the present moment. Open yourself up, get out of your head about it, and let the music wash over you. \n\nOnce you've found a rhythm, it becomes easier to stay in it. So in this way, it captures the same phenomena of \"weight\" that pushes forward, but unlike momentum (which goes to 0 the moment you stop), rhythm has a funny way of getting into your bones. At some point, it becomes who you are. Yet it remains intensely flexible. How delightful to remind yourself that you can change instantly. There are some incredible implications for the Buddhist ideas of non-self.\n\nThe metaphor of \"rhythm\" evokes the image of **dance** and play. This brings me to my favorite part about this metaphor. Rhythm makes space for others. The right partner brings another \"rhythm\" to your life. One that changes yours enough but lets you keep dancing. When your rhythms sync up, they interact constructively. You can do things together that you couldn't without them. Unlike the solitary rock tumbling down the mountain, your social relations are not \"in your way,\" but the right ones expand the realm of possibility. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I want friends and a partner with whom I can dance: where our individual rhythm mutually influences each other, occasionally syncing, leading to those emotions, feelings of well-being, and experiences you can only have from relaxing the boundaries of the self and giving yourself to something bigger than just you.\n\n\"Rhythm\" isn't directional. You don't **have** to be going somewhere. Finding a rhythm can help you get to where you want to go (think rowing/military marching), but a deeper intention about how you are in the world. Unlike the strict directionality of momentum that necessitates a clear goal, rhythm can just as much be a feel. Interestingly it surmounts the distinction between what you are and where you are going (what Simone De Beauvoir discusses in her incredible [Ethics of Ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ethics_of_Ambiguity) calls *facticity* and *transcendence*). Rhythm is a concept for self-understanding, capturing, in a moment, both who you are and past (facts) and where you are going/what you could be. \n\nFinally, the metaphor captures the dynamism of being. Rather than conceptualizing ourselves as static entities with singular directions (think: rock with momentum), rhythm is a metaphor that celebrates our constant movement. To live is to be moved. Moved by the people, landscapes, art, and nature, and in turn, to influence the people and situations that bring joy into our lives. \n\nSo when I next feel that tailwind of compounded consistency, instead of saying I've \"got momentum,\" I will say, \"I've found a *rhythm*.\" \n\n\n\u003e [!quote] Definition - Momentum\n\u003e \n\u003e /m…ô( ä)Ààm…õnt…ôm/ \n\u003e noun:¬†**momentum**;¬†plural noun:¬†**momenta**\n\u003e 1.

Rodin‚Äôs *In The Hand of God*, is also intimate, Adam and Eve are locked in an embryonic embrace, but the mixture of rough uncut marble with the smooth, a distinctly Rodin style, is strikingly primitive as compares to the bronze statue. It depict the primordial moment of creation. The plaque reads:\n\n\u003e ‚Äú[T]he inchoate figures of Adam and Eve [are] cradled in God‚Äôs hand. The composition is an homage to his revered \"master\" Michelangelo, the Renaissance artist whose unfinished figures materializing out of rough stone symbolize the process of artistic creation. In this work, Rodin boldly equates the generative hand of God with the ingenious hand of the sculptor.‚Äù¬†(Figure 1)\n\n![](digital-garden/Rodin/Fig-1.jpg)\nUp to the right, against and parallel to the wall, is another Rodin sculpture. Understated in relation to God‚Äôs hand but strikingly erotic. *Eternal Spring* also depicts an abstract female and male figure locked in a kiss. The statue according to its plaque is about ‚Äúsensuality and impassioned lovemaking‚Äù and depicts the intimate, vulnerable, and ‚Äúwillful surrender‚Äù (Figure 2)\n\nBoth of these marble sculptures were carved in 1907 portray two distinct acts of creation ‚Äî one divine and one human. Here I will considered together these two statues together and use them to reveal Rodin‚Äôs nuanced portrayal of eroticism, vulnerability, and identity in the human creation. ¬†\n\n![](digital-garden/Rodin/Fig-3.jpg)\nAfter lingering (for a suspiciously long time), I noticed a pattern that MET goers follow in their approach and viewing of Eternal Spring. After circling the Hand of God several times, pausing to read the plaque, they were drawn to Eternal Spring. Like satellites leaving the gravitational pull of one body to orbit another, they approached Eternal Spring along a diagonal. Met by the outstretched hand of the male figure, much smaller than God‚Äôs, reaches forward out of the sculpture. It forms the top half of an ‚ÄòS‚Äô that is horizontal, slanted forward, and diagonal in space. The man‚Äôs hand creeps behind the uncut marble wing and grounds the eye‚Äôs journey along his arm, and continues over his head arm along the female‚Äôs arm wrapped around her curves, ending at her bare feet (Figure 3). Unlike the circular frame of The Hand of God, Eternal Spring is framed by a diagonal that is defined by a large ‚ÄòS‚Äô shape along its level change. This ‚ÄòS‚Äô figure is a staple of classical sculpture; indicating a full body. However, this dominating ‚ÄòS‚Äô subverts tradition in its orientation and is formed by two bodies rather than one. Reminiscent of Raphael‚Äôs Disputa, Rodin uses different shapes and symbolism to distinguish elements of human and divine creation.¬†\n  ![](digital-garden/Rodin/Fig-2.jpg)\nThe individual elements of Eternal Spring are also shaped to build on the symbolism and help focus the viewer's perspective. Each of the individual figures has its own ‚ÄòS.‚Äô From the upward-facing feet to the hands of the female figure and the bent, crossed leg from the left body half of the male figure. Along the vertical axis where their bodies meet, there is a straight line from the meeting point of the lips to the male‚Äôs right foot rooted in the rough marble base. Finally, their jaws form the bottom of the circle, which continues through the female's hand along his head. This circular shape formed at the head is identical to the faces in The Hand of God (Figure 3, Appendix). These shapes all help draw the eye to the focal point of the image ‚Äî the kiss ‚Äî and help to create the off-center diagonal perspective most viewers stopped at to view the statue. This position is perpendicular to the point where the female's breast fills the contraction of the male chest (Figure 1, Appendix). From this view, the outstretched male hand invites us to view an incredibly intimate act. The MET‚Äôs image on the web fails to capture this view. It is too frontal, not respecting the diagonal dynamics of the frame. Had Rodin not invited us through his use of shape, it would‚Äôve created a feeling of imposition rather than of invitation. We are invited to view from a particular perspective without shame or guilt. Unlike the Hand of God, which invites viewers to view divine creation from all angles, the passionate sexual act of human creation needs more careful framing.¬†\n  \nOnce properly framed, however, Rodin does not shy away from portraying the dual nature of human creation as both carnal and divine. The woman‚Äôs lower half is prostrated, grounded, reminiscent of prayer, and her feet are fully exposed, a motif of vulnerability in Christological art. The linearity of her lower half contrasts and emphasizes the curvature of her upper half. The deep arch in her lower back heightens her sexual appeal by emphasizing her feminine curvature. Her pose is both erotic and sexual but also divine and vulnerable. Like the discomfort one can feel in extended periods of prayer, sex often includes poses that are also uncomfortable. But it is a discomfort that is forgotten. Though the pose is very clearly an uncomfortable one, it is self-aware in its framing, thereby conveying an authenticity that portrayals of eroticism so often lack.¬†\n\n\nThis authenticity, in part, comes from Rodin‚Äôs style of leaving rough unsmoothed marble in his statues. Even in The Hand of God, he does not let us forget the materiality and earthiness of creation. Unlike Bernini, who obscures the materiality of his sculptures, Rodin highlights it. Man comes from God but is fashioned from the Earth. No act of creation, even the first, can escape this reality. So when the human figure is revealed by its contrasting smooth against the background of rough marble and emanates from the rough, we are reminded of where we come from. This honesty of materiality gives both of Rodin‚Äôs statues a texture of veracity, which then helps us view the sexual act without shame or guilt.¬†\n  \nRodin departs from this style of demarcation where the two figures meet. In both statues, they form a coextensive smooth surface. It is unclear where one ends, and the other begins; In Eternal Spring, the clear diagonal line serves as a non-boundary. Which, in addition to the abstractly rendered classical faces, connote a lack of identity. However, the conditions of the effacement are radically different. In The Hand of God, Adam and Eve don‚Äôt yet have an identity. They are ‚Äúinchoate‚Äù in the embryo of God‚Äôs hand.¬† Therefore their effacement of identity isn‚Äôt significant because they are innocent of identity. However, in the human act of creation, in all its sensuality and divinity, the loss of identity is ‚Äúwillful.‚Äù Just as vulnerability is meaningless if you‚Äôve never been hurt, so too is loss of individuality when you have no identity. Similar to the bittersweet moment of the man‚Äôs fall in Milton‚Äôs Paradise Lost, it is only after Adam and Eve become aware of their nakedness and feel shame are they truly human. It is only after identity can willful effacement be meaningful.¬†\n\n  \nIt is on this question of what it means to be human I want to make my final observation. While so many elements of these statues are abstract, the most naturalistically rendered objects in both are the hands. In The Hand of God, we see, in great detail and at scale, the veins, micro-musculature, and texture formed by the folds of the skin of his hands. (Figure 4) He is drawing attention to the hands as creative tools. The plaque reminds us that Rodin ‚Äúboldly equates the generative hand of God with the ingenious hand of the sculptor.‚Äù¬† The hand, with its opposable thumbs, is our most distinct feature. Hands make artistic creation possible. This conceptual framing helps us understand the naturalistic hands in Eternal Spring. The female figure is gripping the male figure's head, and his hand embraces her arm from behind. The detail of the hands is striking. This embrace is similar to the one in The Hand of God, but it is intentional and forceful. The man's fingers are much closer together, indicating a tension contrasting God's relaxed, spacious fingers. Combined with the earthy and honest style, the diverse role of the hands is brought to mind. We use our hands to work, fight and survive, but also to pray, paint, and caress.¬†\n\n\nCreation and identity are mutually constitutive, and hands are or medium for both. Hands and their products, more so than faces or bodies, are what distinguish us. They are our tools of demarcation from nature, which Rodin suggests through the mixed materiality of rough and smooth marble and the smooth human emanating from rough marble. Simultaneously they are what demarcates us from animals. God is defined by the creation of humans and by creation. Sex is both an act of creation and a symbol of what drives us to create in the first place. The non-boundary along the diagonal of the man and woman in both statues indicates this. However, in the non-naive human act, each figure has its own ‚ÄòS‚Äô shape indicating a human identity and the ‚ÄòS‚Äô they form together. Rodin's incredible display of eroticism and ‚Äúwillful surrender‚Äù shows us that human creation requires a willingness to momentarily efface oneself, which can only happen if we dare to pose: erotic, prostrate, and all that is in between.¬†\n\n![](digital-garden/Rodin/Fig-4.jpg)\nImages taken by the author at the MET, February 26th, 2023.¬†\n\n\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:33:43.834231836Z","tags":[]},"/digital-garden/Ruby":{"title":"Ruby","content":"\n\u003e When you don‚Äôt create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability.

Arguably, none have. In Linda Zagzebski‚Äôs paper *The Inescapability of Gettier Problems* she claims that the approach to add or refine the ‚Äújustification components'' of JTB+/TB+ accounts are doomed to fail. So long as truth is not entailed by justification, which is to say it is possible to have justified *false* beliefs, these approaches will never be immune to Gettier cases. In this essay I reconstruct Zagzebski‚Äôs convincing argument and apply it to Nozick's theory of knowledge which claims to have dealt with Gettier cases. I argue that one way to understand Zagzebski‚Äôs argument is as manifestation of a broader tension between our fallibility as knowers and our desire for knowledge to infallible. Finally, using ideas developed throughout this essay I suggest ways forward for the field of epistemology as it struggles to define its central object of analysis.¬†\n\nZagzebski begins her analysis of Gettier cases with a discussion of the role of luck. She wrties, \"[w]hat generates the problem for JTB, then, is that an accident of bad luck is canceled out by an accident of good luck. The right goal is reached, but only by chance.\" (pg 66). Smith, our regular epistemic patsy, has an accident of ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù that breaks the link between justification and truth. In the Gettier case of Brown in Barcelona, Smith's justification for the proposition \"John owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona\" is that John told him he owns a Ford. Smith‚Äôs epistemic \"bad luck\" in this case is that John has lied, which is unlike his otherwise trustworthy nature.  Smith forms a justified false belief.  In the case of Fake Barns, Smith drives through the countryside, where unbeknownst to him, he is surrounded by fake barns. Although he points to a real barn and correctly says \"this is a barn\" he is unaware that his method of justification is not reliable in this situation. Therefore the justification and the truth have come apart. However after the accident of \"bad luck\" Smith gets a stroke of ‚Äúgood luck.‚Äù Brown happens to be in Barcelona, making the disjunction \"John owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona\" true. Smith luckily picks out the one real barn in a sea of fake barns. For reasons completely independent of the justification, the accident of \"good luck\" fixes the belief. In Brown in Barcelona the justified false belief turns into a justified true belief. Even though Smith reached the \"right goal,\" because it was \"only by chance\"¬† we do not want to grant these as cases of knowledge. Knowledge as we understand it normativley and descrpiptivley,¬†is more robust and not as contingent. Yet, so long as there is space between justification and truth, Zagzebski claims that all JTB+ account can be hacked in this way. Because these accidents of \"luck\" cannot be fully systematically accounted for.¬†\n\nZagzebski's argument turns on the claim that this \"good luck'' cannot be systematically accounted for. Even if the ‚Äújustification component‚Äù blocked specif cases of \"good luck\" from consituting knowledge, we could always find another way to fix the belief. As long as there is space between justification and truth, further specification or additional criteria doesn't help. Zagzebski demonstrates the generality of her claim by walking us through a recipe to generate Gettier cases for Alvin Plantinga‚Äôs new JTB+ account where he replaces the concept ‚Äújustification‚Äù with the one of \"warrant.\" Plantinga's component of justification, \"warrant,\" attempt to block Gettier cases where the environment is abnormal (i.e cases of lying or rouge modern artists with a predilection for fake barns). Yet this further refinement doesn't help, since all we have to do is artificially construct a \"warranted false belief\" (which is possible by his admission) and creativley fix it with ‚Äúgood luck.‚Äù This is exactly what Zagzebski does. Mary has good eyesight and often sees her husband sitting in the chair inside the living room. Under the same conditions of lighting, regular functioning eyesight, no abnormal environment (no one is dressing up as her husband), and where she has every reason to believe her husband‚Äôs brother is in Australia, she forms the warranted false belief ‚Äúmy husband is sitting in the living room‚Äù when it in fact her husband's brother in the char. Now let‚Äôs create some of the ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù that resists sytematization: her husband is actually sitting in the living room out of sight from Mary. We have now produced a Gettier case of warranted, true belief that is accidental. Zagzebski claims regrdless of the JTB+ account we always will be able to. \n\nA helpful analogy to understand Zagzebski's argument is to think of countable and uncountable infinite sets. A set is countably infinite if we can write it down in some ordering. There is a mapping from the natural numbers to the set. A set is uncountably infinite, such as the set of real number, if no such mapping is possible. In this case, the number of ways \"good luck\" can make fix a justified belief that has come apart from the truth is uncountably infinite. All possible necessary conditions/\"justification components\" is countably infinite. Even without this mathematical analog it is clear that given any arbitrarily number of ‚Äújustification components‚Äù we can always produce another accident of ‚Äúgood luck.‚Äù So long as justified and truth can come apart occur due to ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù¬†there will always¬†be uncountably \"more\" accidents of good luck we need only to get creative to find. Therefore, Zagzebski concludes Gettier cases are inescapable for JTB+ accounts.¬†Gettier problems are not inescapble for all account of knowledge however. ‚ÄúSince justification does not guarantee truth, it is possible for there to be a break in the connection between justification and truth, but for the connection to be regained by chance.‚Äù (pg 65). Both Gettier and Zagzebski explicitly focus on accounts of knowledge where justification does not entail truth. With our back against the wall, one might ask why not close the gap between justification and truth, to raise the epistemic bar of justification or a similar concept to a degree that it guarantees truth. However, justification and its related concepts are precisely what helps us determine what is true and what is false. So to force p to be true all cases where S is justified in believing that p drains the concept of its use, and to render the \"truth\" condition on knowledge redundant. Such approaches is certainly possible, but these are not targeted by Zagzebski argument. \n  \nZagzebski‚Äôs claim is abstract but opeates concretly. Give me your JTB+ account and I‚Äôll give you a Gettier cases that beats it. Nozick's famous (failed) TB+ account of knowledge that ostensibly blocked Gettier cases presents an interesting example of this dialectic. Nozick's account of knowledge as \"belief that tracks the truth\" linked  truth and justification through counterfactual dependence. Using the subjunctive condition we ask if it *were* not the case \"John owned a Ford or Brown was in Barcelona'' (p), would Smith believe it to? In other words is Smith's belief sensitive to the truth (stability condition) and falsity (sensitivity condition) of the proposition believed. In the the Brown in Barcelona case, Smith would continue to falsely belief p because his justification was based on John's faulty testimony. Smith's belief is insensitive to the truth of p, therefore not knowledge. However, Saul Kripke's takedown is as devastating as it is illustrative. One of the the most famous of his recipes that broke down Nozick's account was to vary an accidental feature of the visual experience. In the case of the Fake Barns, if all real barns are painted red then under Nozick‚Äôs account Smith knows that the barn is red but doesn't know that it is a barn. This ridiculous failure of closure of knowledge under known entailment is known as the abominable conjunction. Although the ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù in this case operates differently than in the examples Zagzebski uses, it shows how \"good luck\" circumvents the \"justification component\" of Nozick's account. Smith had the good luck that the barns were color coded, and this hacked the condition It made his belief sensitive so that in nearby possible worlds where it was false, he wouldn't believe it and in nearby possible worlds where it is true, he would. Had Nozick come up with another justification component, we would be able to generate a different Gettier case, with luck playing a different role. Even though Nozick's justification looks very different to other TB+ accounts, Nozick's still failed to escape Gettier cases because the additional senstivity and stability conditions that tested the relation between justification and truth, didn't guarantee truth. Luck intervened. \n\nIf we accept Zagzebski's claim about the inescapablity of Gettier cases in TB+ accouts, what are we to do with them? I believe these attempts are valubale even if they failed to by their own standard. Different \"justification component\" systematize an intution we want knowledege to have. Even if we give up specifying a set of jointly sufficient conditions on knowledge there is still value in specifying necessary conditions. Kripke never clarified his thoughts on if counterfactual dependence should remain a necessary condition on knowledge. I think the silence on the point says something. Nozick captured a powerful normative intution about knowledge, which even if it breaks in unacceptable ways when it tries to claim sufficency for knowledge it may still be useful when assesing knowledge claims as necessary conditions. Similarly other failed attemps such as reliabalism or \"warant\" may work better in differnt contexts. \n\nZagzebski argument captures a very broader tension in epistemology between our desire for knowledge to be infallible¬†but recognition that our methods for acquiring it aren't. David Lewis disucsses falliabalism in his Elusive Knowledge, where he lays out a lucid context-dependent account of knowledge. He writes ‚Äú... it seems as if knowledge must be by definition infallible. If you claim that S knows that P, and yet you grant that S can not eliminate a certain possibility in which not-P, it certainly seems as if you have granted that S does not after all know that P. To speak of fallible knowledge, of knowledge despite uneliminated possibilities of error, just sounds contradictory.‚Äù (pg) Yet in spite of saying this and his later claim that contextualism provides a way out of both skepticism and fallibilism, his theory of context is one of *proper ignoring*. In almost all contexts, we are allowed to properly ignore certain possibilities, and therefore by Lewis' own words allowing knowledge to be falliable. Only in the strictest context (i.e an epistemology seminar) do all not-P possibilities have to be eliminated including the skeptical hypothesis. In this context, knowledge is infaliable, but we also know nothing about the contingent external world. Lewis write, ‚Äúmaybe ascriptions of knowledge are subtly context-dependent, and maybe epistemology is a context that makes them go false. Then epistemology would be an investigation that destroys its own subject matter.‚Äù  His tacit captiulation to falliabalism as context dependendent opens up ways in which JTB+ analyses my be helpful. What if contexts could be specified by necessary conditions for knowledge claims within them. If contexts grant a degree of fallibalism to knowledge it is the task of the epistemologist to systematize and understand that degree of falliability best they can.\n\nZagzebski argument demonstrates how the \"luck\" generates Gettier cases so long as there is any space between justification and truth. This luck resists being systematized. Even if an aspect of it was systematized and therefore blocked by a \"component of justification\" in a JTB+ account, we could always produce another that circumvents it. Looking forward then in our analysis of knowldege I suggest focused on a change of tact. Instead of focsuing on sufficient conditions for knowledge we focus on the neccessary ones, there is space for useful analyses of knowledge and context. Our creativity to construct cases of \"good luck\" and specify necessary conditions on knowledge that specify links between justification and truth that are important, can be immensly useful when tied to context. If we accept what Lewis tacitly does, namely that  knowledge is fallible on the basis of context, Gettier cases become useful to generate concepts of spurious justification which we can decide as relevant or not in given contexts.  Gettier cases aren't escaped, but at least they aren't \"problems\" anymore.","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:33:43.882233102Z","tags":[]},"/work-in-progress/College-Language-Computation":{"title":"College - Language \u0026 Computation","content":"\n\u003e[!WARN]\n\u003eAn ongoing note on college, extracting value from an institution whose interests don't always align with yours.

The academy is a wonderful place, and its mere existence is a testament to the success of society, nothing is more insufferable than academics who forget that. \n\n\n\nMoves - Creating (and constantly tweaking) a joint Philosophy-Computer Science Major:\n\nThis course of study has emerged as I've followed interests and professors that ignited something in me. \n\nIt was first proposed in my junior year where I combined my interest in language, formal semantics and Natural Language processing, but has changed every semester as my interest shifted and I responded to the quality of professors teaching the class. \n\nOne piece of advice I give anyone entering college is to get clear on what's really valuable about the experience. Colleges have a narrative about what they are for. Its mostly bullshit and doesn't foreground your interests.  Rather in the overly quantified period of time we live in, push toward quick metrics such as starting salaries, and graduation rates. There's a reason (elite) colleges don't do a happiness index on their graduating students. \n\nI am shamelessly ruthless when it comes to professors. If I get a bad vibe, or poor pedagogy, I'm out. College is too short to suffer though bad professors, and it is a unique opportunity to find mentors and masters to inititate you into a field.\n\n- Learn from a place, what it can best teach you:\nLearning how to program and build tech is best learnt on the job, not in a class. Reading timeless texts, and talking and writing about other people is invaluable. So is being introduced to disciplines by masters of the craft. \n\nCollege has been about learning how to read, write, think and orient myself in a world of overwhelming possibility and false authority.  developing a sense of what to ignore not because it is bad, but because of the finitude of attention\nIt has been about building a community of friends, and interlocultors.  .

These unicorns (yes, they exist) do not make you deeply competent by the end of their course. Rather they initiate you into a world. You learn the language, methods, history, and actions that tie the community together. You learn what constitutes \"truth\" and \"beauty.\"  You observe *how* they do things rather than *what* they do. The best teachers are often those who come to it late because they remember what it is like to be part of the uninitiated. They understand their task as revealing a new world rather than a myopic and pathological need to grade and assess.  \n\n[Caitlin Trainor](https://www.trainordance.org/about-1) and her classes in *Modern Dance* have been that for me. It has stood out as one of the most important classes I will take in college. I've had some [incredible professors] during my time. Yet she is the first with whom I've felt the need to take more classes.\n\nCaitlin takes it upon herself to make us better people through dance. Her lessons though conveyed through language and concepts ‚Äî transcend them. Easeful body language, graceful movement, comfort in one's skin,  failing (forward) with verve. It is a new epistemology‚Äîone of embodied knowledge. \n\nPhilosophically (and with almost criminal generality), the fundamental dichotomy of Western epistemology (the study of knowledge) is reason vs. appearance (think Plato). The epistemology of Dance (the knowledge from it) doesn't operate at that distinction. It is, as much art is, about the internal vs. external. \n\nDance complicates that primitive distinction. It pushes past the concepts so the seeming fundamental opposition between them is resolved (or hints) at ways to transcend the fundamentally opposed nature of the internal and external. Dance is dialectical. \n\nThere is the externality of choreography and music, but the internality of movement, muscle activation, and relaxation. Dance is a form that can blur the boundaries of the self.\n\nRight now, these are pretty raw thoughts. Its a journal.

You are not merely looking up or listening, but opening yourself. It is a different kind of intelligence. A different kind of response to overwhelm and complexity. Which is not to tunnel surrunder to you intelligence that arises from the opening. You need to turn off the thinking mind, and allow the automatic form take over.

At first sight, around my freshman year in college, it struck me as another banal, virtue-signaling slogan. Classifying tech as \"good\" or \"bad\" was pretty straightforward, I thought. It isn't. It gets even more complicated when you look at the decision engineers face when deciding where to work. How do we understand individual responsibility of individuals creators in the complex, and overwhelmingly world. \n\nThe difficulty comes partly from the historical fact that intentions (un)fortunately don't count. Gene editing is a technology that could save us from world hunger or be used to manufacture deadly viruses. Today's most important technologies ‚Äî flight, radio, the computer, the internet ‚Äî began as military projects, yet could be the foundations of utopia.\n\nNo matter how good or bad technology may *seem*, we can never be sure of its impact on society. This might sound theoretical or historical, but for engineers and technologists who see themselves as powerful and their work as political (both of which are true, as I will argue), **nothing is more practical than the questions of what to build and what not to**. \n\nMy goal here is to outline a framework for the political programmer. This essay, however, is not just for programmers. It's for anyone who is shaped by technology, which is to say almost everyone. \n\nI will not try to answer if technology is \"good\" or \"bad\" on the basis of what it does. Instead, I will look at how it was made‚Äî its \"technique.\" This approach comes from a seemingly unlikely source: a WWII German-Jewish political theorist of art, philosopher, and critic Walter Benjamin. Benjamin, wrote during the rise of fascism in Italy, Nazism in Germany, while Communism and Capitalism. Art, regardless of whether the author intended it, was political. In this situation \n\nan artwork's \"technique\" is inextricably linked to its social, economic, political, and material conditions. He analyzeses technique to ask a surprisingly subtle question: can art change a society that led to its production? I hope to ask the same about technology.\n\nThrough this essay, I will develop a parallel between the 21st-century programmer and the 20th-century artist. Using Benjamin's essay [\"The Author as Producer\"](https://yaleunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Walter_Benjamin_-_The_Author_as_Producer.pdf) I reconstruct some of his critical ideas on the political nature of the artist and his notion of their \"technique\". Specifically, I conceptualize 'Big Tech' and 'Open Source' as \"techniques\" for producing technology and then analyze them as techniques using Benjamin's political framework. This forms the basis of the political programmer, a new way of understanding the individual programmer's role in shaping political reality. \n\n## Inescapably \"Political\":  Art \u0026 Technology\n\nTechnology and art are often described as magic. Magic is always political. Technology and art are potent political forces ‚Äî for good or for evil. \n\nWriting and living during WWII, Walter Benjamin saw Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy weaponize art for the latter purpose. Art, \"aesthetics,\" more broadly, was used to manufacture a society willing to endure brutal and genocidal means for a \"beautiful\" end. \n\nBenjamin saw the blank canvas as a place to imagine new and better societies. In the revolutionary context of late 19th and early 20th century Europe, where questions of how to govern society were reignited with the rise of Marxism, art was the medium to collectively imagine and eventually create a society of human flourishing that had never existed before.\n\nThis duality of the utopic emancipatory and dystopic tyrannical potential is shared \n\n\n- Technology, such as photography, radio, film, and the newspaper changed the\"art.\"  Not only expanding its consumption to the masses, but changed what was made. \n- As such, Benjamin takes a *materialist* approach to his political analysis of art. Instead of focusing on the content or form of the artwork, or the \"ideas\" around art, he examins the art in the social, political and technological conditions within which it is produced. Specifically, in the context of capitalism, he ask the deeply relevant question we grapple with today: can art truly change a society that enables its production?\n\n## Definition of the Programmer \nBefore I lay out that theory, I want to discuss the definition of a programmer. As the title suggests, I‚Äôve defined the programmer as the producer of technology. But who gets to produce technology?¬†  \n\nIn Author as Producer (1934), Benjamin proclaims that amidst technological innovation and new political demands, we must expand our old \"notions of literary form\" and ‚Äúauthorship‚Äù to find new \"forms appropriate to the literary energy of our time.\" Today, I argue, we must similarly expand our notion of a programmer. Not merely because of new technology but because our fundamental relationship with technology is changing. Now more than ever, and at an increasing rate, we are creating technology ‚Äî not just using it.¬†¬†\n\nWith the rise of Personal Computers, the proliferation of software and the internet, accessibility of information, and greater intimacy with digital tools, these new material conditions of innovation have dramatically changed our relationship with technology: from user to the producer. This change is still underway, but the rise of¬† '[power-users](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Power%20user)' ‚Äî users who customize their technology for a specific use ‚Äî clearly demonstrates that the line between user and producer is blurring. TikTok and Instagram users build custom filters; graphic designers and music producers regularly extend and connect the digital tools that make their work possible. These power-users, who are often artists but range from productivity nerds to gardening hobbyists, are, for the first time, becoming the producers of the technology they use. This trend is most visible in software but is not limited to it. Affordable micro-controllers like the Arduino and RaspberryPi make bringing code into the physical world more straightforward [than ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCcO-6lb9zM\u0026t=38s). Though there are very real and pressing inequalities in access to technology and education, it is theoretically possible to modify and shape technology like never before. We can all produce technology and, therefore, all become programmers. I believe realizing this theoretical possibility is immensely emancipatory. The professional programmer, who epitomizes the producer's relationship with technology, much like the artist, has an essential role in determining if we do or not. So although this essay is focused on the professional programmer, the implications of their work to recruit non-programmers into the fold, or prevent this, extend into politics and and the  far beyond.¬†\n\n\n## Literary Technique  \nBenjamin begins Author as Producer by criticizing the common debate between a literary work's political commitment, its ‚Äútendency,‚Äù and its literary ‚Äúquality.‚Äù¬† On the one hand, work with a ‚Äògood‚Äô political commitment but of ‚Äòpoor‚Äô quality is clearly not great. But on the other hand, what about work with a terrible ‚Äútendency‚Äù of high artistic ‚Äúquality?‚Äù [Triumph of the Will,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will) the infamous Nazi propaganda film is a typical provocative example of these kinds of works. Can a work that tries to bring about a ‚Äòbad‚Äô political end be truly great? The debate rages on, even today. Benjamin believes that ‚Äútendency\" and \"quality\" are superficial, dead-end concepts. He writes, ‚Äú[y]ou are familiar with it, [‚Äòtendency‚Äô vs. ‚Äòquality‚Äô,] and so you know how unfruitful the debate has been. For the fact is that this debate has never got beyond a boring ‚Äòon-the-one-hand‚Äô, ‚Äòon-the-other-hand‚Äô[...].‚Äù Instead of asking about a work‚Äôs tendency, which is seldom straightforward except in the most extreme cases, Benjamin introduces the concept of technique by asking a different question. \"Before I ask what is a work's position vis-√†-vis the production relations of its time, I should like to ask: what is its position within them? This question concerns the function of a work within the literary production of its time. In other words, it is directly concerned with literary technique.\" (Benjamin, pg 87). Benjamin shits the focus of criticism from a work's political ends to its position within the ‚Äúliving and breathing production relation.‚Äù Not to ask what it says, but instead what it does. To answer the latter question, particularly for a Marxist, we must look at how it was produced¬† ‚Äî its ‚Äútechnique.‚Äù Only when it is considered in these dynamic material terms can we understand the unique, self-referential power art has to change the society that enabled its production.¬†\n\nThis question is not limited to criticism of capitalism (produced under/using it) but extends to any work that hopes to change society. For example, the Netflix ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù¬† The Social Dilemma, is promoted on social media, using the same unethical and user-privacy abusing algorithms it attacks. Banksy‚Äôs artwork, critical of the obscene pricing of art and authority of art institutions, sells for millions at auction houses (three times as much when [half-shredded](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034962331/banksy-shredder-girl-with-balloon-love-is-in-the-bin-auction-sothebys)!). Benjamin poses a subtler question: can art change its conditions of production, or is it condemned to reproducing them, try as they might? Benjamin believes art can, but we must look to the material ‚Äútechnique‚Äù to understand how.\n\n\nTechnique is a philosophically loaded term Benjamin uses extensively throughout his work. Broadly defined as ‚Äúthe medium through which we humans [...] [shape the world](https://journals.openedition.org/am/944),‚Äù technique includes tools and how we use them ‚Äî technology and the social relations of prodcution ‚Äî but also how those tools shape us. Technique, according to Benjamin, ‚Äúmakes literary products accessible to immediate social, and therefore materialist, analysis. At the same time, the concept of technique represents the dialectical starting-point from which the sterile dichotomy of form and content can be surmounted.\" (Benjamin, pg 88).¬† The dichotomy is \"surmounted\" because \"technique\" considers how content, form, art, and artist are inextricably linked by the material conditions. Just as the editing tools of Photoshop and the distribution platform of Instagram, for example, influence form, so too do economic and societal norms on what users engage with influence the content. He calls the concept a ‚Äúdialectical starting point‚Äù since it gets us beyond the limited ‚Äúon-the-one-hand, on the other-hand-debate‚Äù to a more productive one centered on ‚Äútechnique.‚Äù This focus helps us answer the question of a work's ‚Äúfunction.‚Äù\n\n- Benjamin redefines ‚Äòtendency‚Äô in terms of progressive or regressive technique.¬† \n- The former improves conditions and the latter re-enforces conditions of production. Benjamin writes, ‚Äú[w]e can now affirm more precisely that literary tendency may consist in a progressive development of literary technique, or in a regressive one.\"¬† \n- The question for the critic is now no longer if a work has the right content or form but instead if it brings about a progressive or regressive technique. \n- For example, a work whose content might be critical of capitalism but whose technique only strengthens its production relations falls short. Whereas a work whose content might, somehow, affirm its conditions but its technique somehow subverts them, it can (in theory) be emancipatory. So now the question is: what makes a technique progressive or regressive? The final part of this op-ed focuses on this question, but we now have enough Benjamin to shift the focus onto the programmer and technology. After which returning to this question becomes more productive. True to Benjamin's materialist approach, I start with how technology is produced ‚Äî its means of production.\n\n## Open Source Vs Big Tech \nOpen Source and Big Tech are the dominant ways programmers produce modern-day technology. ¬†Big Tech is a conventional capitalist means of production, whereas Open Source is a unique means of production with four distinctive characteristics:¬†\n\n1. Code is written by (historically) unpaid programmers¬†\n2. Collaboration is enabled through the internet using a transparent version control protocol ([Git](https://git-scm.com/)) hosted, most popularly, on [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n3. No one owns the code ‚Äî anyone can distribute, use, clone(fork), and modify it\n4. Open Source is community-driven and strives to make adding to the project's code as accessible as possible through documentation and educational resources.¬†\n\nI define Big Tech and Open Source (with capitalization) as a theoretical set of practices, ideas, and producer relations. Anyone who has experience with real open source projects knows many fall short on one or more of the characteristics listed above. Still, the incredible success and unquantifiable value of technology produced in this way, most notably the [Linux Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjMZssWMweA), make its unique characteristics worthy of independent, theoretical analysis. \n\nOpen Source was once the dominant way all software was produced, but it solidified as a counterculture in the late '70s and early '80s when programmer hobbyists were frustrated that they could not view, fix bugs, or modify Big Tech‚Äôs closed, proprietary software. They saw Big Tech companies such as Windows and IBM who profited from proprietary software as betraying the open culture of sharing that characterized early software and the internet.¬† In contrast, Big Tech is a method of producing technology where programmers are paid in exchange for writing code, and the surplus-value of their labor goes to shareholders of the company. This code cannot be viewed, modified, or freely distributed. In the early 90‚Äôs Big Tech demonstrated that proprietary software could be immensely profitable since software could be resold for zero marginal cost. Between 1995 and 2000 there was a rush of speculative investment that eventually led to the crash known as the [dot com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble). Markets soon stablized; capital and Big Tech have since been entwined. The Big Tech means of producing technology has come to be the standard. Open Source on the other hand has plugged in relative obscurity.¬† With minimal capital, open source communities have managed to create immense value by building critical infrastructure tools ‚Äî such as programming language, operating systems, databases, etc. However, Open Source is resurging today, and capital is beginning to enter it as companies demonstrate that profit is still possible, and in some cases, more likely, with an open source codebase. This rise of Open Source is immensely exciting, and has, as I will argue, immense emancipatory potential, which lies in its progressive technique.¬†\n\n\nThe technique of Open Source is progressive since it empowers users by turning them from isolated passive individuals into a community of active technology producers. Open Source, by its nature, is has an existential need for collaboration and community.¬† If it is too difficult to use, or to contribute to the project dies by neglect ‚Äîthe fate of 99.9% of open source projects. As such this existential need for community impacts everything from the kind of programmers it attracts to the quality of the code; from the tech stack used and its architecture to the tutorials and documentation on using it. Making the technology understandable and possible to contribute to impacts everything about the creation process, and what even gets made. By recruiting its users to producers Open Source does what Benjamin praises the Soviet press for; it weakens the distinction between reader and author. In Benjamin's analogous analysis of the newspaper, he writes:\n\n\n\u003e \"For as literature gains in breadth what it loses in depth, so the distinction between author and public, which the bourgeois press maintains by artificial means, is beginning to disappear in the Soviet press. \\[...] The vast melting-down process of which I spoke \\[...] questions even the separation between author and reader. The press is the most decisive point of reference for this process \\[...]\" For, as we know, the newspaper in Western Europe does not yet represent a valid instrument of production in the writer's hands. It still belongs to capital.\" (Benjamin, pg 90)¬†\n\n\nThe Soviet press, which Benjamin saw as filled with emancipatory promise, enabled the worker to go from a passive reader to an active writer. The technique of its production empowered the proletariat as a community to shape the forces that shaped them. Uncannily, Open Source does the same. It bonds users and producers together, through forums and discussion boards to collectively shape the technology that shapes them. These active developer communities ‚Äî armies of volunteer contributors ‚Äî who flag bugs, test features, write documentation, and build useful features are the envy of Big Tech companies.¬†\n\n  \n\nIn contrast, Big Tech is analogous to the newspaper of Western Europe, which works to maintain the distinction between user and producer through \"artificial means.\" Most obviously, by not sharing the source code, but more perniciously, through its technique. Since the public does not see the code, it is notoriously poorly documented, hard to understand, and idiosyncratic to the point of incomprehensibility to those outside the company. Big Tech overspecializes its programmers, and its long onboarding practices are evidence of its incomprehensibility. It trains programmers to operate on a narrow scope, and most importantly, does not cultivate the ability to communicate their contributions to outsiders of the organization. Combined with exclusionary hiring practices, often from feeder schools such as Columbia, MIT, and Harvard,¬† Big Tech selects and trains a politically impotent programmer.¬† Programmer are alienated from the technology they produce (in a codebase of millions of lines, individuals cannot see their contribution to the whole) and they lack the power to build in other collaborative, non-Big Tech, settings. In stark opposition to Open Source, the technique creates the pressure for obscurity rather than transparency. Under these conditions we have the most problematic and irresponsible uses of technology, which perpetuate social inequality and alienation.¬†\n\n  \n\nAt this point, many might contest the definition of Open Source and Big Tech, as well as generality of the claims I have made about their respective techniques. On the former objection, they contest that the neat, theoretical distinction doesn‚Äôt exist. This is absolutely correct. In reality, all technology is produced on a spectrum between Big Tech and Open Source. Some companies with open codebases might be using the technique of Big Tech, and similarly Big Tech companies, despite the provocative name, might practice the Open Source technique.¬†\n\n  \n\nDespite this complex reality I have hoped to theoretically distinguish between the two to arrive at¬†\n\n  \n\n¬†and idealizing the distinctive aspects it has allowed me to analyze the technique substantially.¬† This is helpful because although the relationship began antagonistically,¬† they are now interacting in exciting and troubling ways. Open Source projects are turning into large companies backed by (venture) capital. On the other hand, paradigmatic Big Tech companies such as Google and Microsoft are open-sourcing (yes, it is a verb) internal tools and code which generally would have remained closed. It is precisely these mixed cases that have motivated this op-ed, and where a discerning, theoretical discussion of their technique, rooted in Benjamin‚Äôs analysis of the Soviet Press and of Western Europe, is helpful.¬†\n\n  \n\nOn the latter objection, namely of the overstated impact of technique on the programmer, I am not saying all programmers become like this. Many of the best and most politically potent programmers in the world work at paradigmatic Big Tech companies. But I am claiming that they likely have resisted the incentives and pressures of conditions which are not conducive to developing that potency. Conversely, working on Open Source does not guarantee potency, but it makes it more likely.¬†\n\n  \n\nSo far, I have argued that the technique of Open Source is progressive and therefore, emancipatory because it, unlike its counterpoint, works to empower its users to producers. Does this remain even when capital enters into it? Yes. While Big Tech ‚Äúbelongs to capital‚Äù Open Source uses it. It uses capital in a way that questions the very production relations of conventional capitalism. It also allows technology to be shaped by humans for humans, not by humans for capital. Open Source accomplishes these lofty claims in a number of ways which, in concert, gradually becomes increasingly emancipatory. There is far too much to discuss here, so I¬† will focus on three.\n\n  \n\nFirst, it questions traditional producer relations and shallow theories of why we work. The success of Open Source is mind-blowing and complicates the (simplistic/Smithian) conventional capitalist theory of labor. The most crucial technologies upon which the internet and trillions of dollars of economic activity have been made are built by communities of programmer hobbyists, self-organizing, and working for free. Big Tech relies on and re-enforces the idea that workers work because they are paid. So, for example, when a team of five passionate Open Source programmers volunteer their time and build a thriving community and a better product than teams of a 100 funded by billions of dollars of revenue from Google, the phenomenon calls into question the Big Tech, capitalist means of producing technology. Programmers are driven by more than shallow self-interest, but by a desire for community, recognition, and craftsmanship. The major platform for Open Source, GitHub, enables a transparent record of every line of code and every comment/discussion made by an individual, even in a complex codebase. This radical transparency and tracking allow for individual contributors to be recognized and recognize their contributions to a greater whole. Unlike the programmers of Big Tech, they are not alienated from their labor. This in it of itself is worth serious consideration.¬†\n\n  \n\nSecond, it empowers workers with choice and a clear record of their contributions. They can choose to work on any project they desire, moving from project to project, developing a resum√© that is their GitHub record of all their work. This allows these programmers to find and work on problems they truly care about and find interesting.¬†\n\n¬†Finally, the transparency of the technique influences the kind of technology that even gets built. The most politically oppressive technology can only be produced under the cover of obscurity. Especially as there is greater concern about the ethical implications of technologies, many of the worst uses can be averted through openness. The mere transparency or lack thereof guides technology into emancipatory or tyrannical directions.¬†¬†\n\n  \n\nUnderlying Open Source's emancipatory potential is its technique which empowers us to create and see ourselves as part of that human collective process of shaping the world. The psychological implications are just as empowering as the political ones. It is about time the programmer, in the broadest sense, recognizes both. With this recognition the programmer becomes a more intentional and potent political force that can bring about this future rather than, often times, unknowingly, prevent it.¬†\n\n  \n\nThe material conditions have changed and we must change with them. There is no going back to pre-technology, pre-internet, or pre-BigTech. For better or worse, technology mediates our experiences of art, the world, and ourselves. Technology has changed the way we live and shape the world, and fundamentally our relationship with technology is changing beneath our feet. It is important for everyone to develop their identity as programmers and embrace the political responsibility of that. Rather than allowing market incentives to shape technology, we must demand an active role in shaping it. This is no longer an empty cry, but one that can be realized. Open Source engenders community, diminishes the distinction between users and producers, and empowers us to shape our technology. Capital inflow has accelerated and empowered Open Source, but we must be cautious that its technique remains transparent and encouraging ‚Äî the basis of its emancipatory potential. Professional programmers have the power to vote with their feet, time, and skills. The decisions about what to work on matters, but so does how it is worked on too. I share in Benjamin's cautious optimism that technology can bring about a better, freer future. Whether is used for those ends or as a tool for social control, is still to be decided ‚Äî by us. So then I will end, perhaps fittingly, with a call to action to all my readers ‚Äî not only to ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô programmers. Here goes:\n\n  \n\nUnless you live alone under a literal rock, you, my reader, most definitely interact with technology. It can often feel like the forces that govern technology are out of your control. This is not true. Remember, \"all that is solid melts into air.\" You must demand of your technology what you want. Do not throw your hands up in frustration the moment things get technical. I am not advocating you go back to school and get a degree in Computer Science, or even learn to code. I am advocating to Know Thy Tools. If you use a piece of software regularly, learn it. Learn the shortcuts, and learn where and how you can customize it to do what you want. If you find that you cannot customize it, take the time to research other tools you can. Many of these will be Open Source or use its technique. Choose to use Open Source projects with vibrant communities even if they are rougher around the edges. Join their community Slack or Discord, and voice your frustrations. Talk to the programmers creating these products because they, unlike the programmers at Apple, or Google, will likely listen. In doing so, you are becoming empowered as a producer of technology. Your digital tools are as much a part of you as your limbs. They are the digital nervous system that allows you to shape the world and the people in it.¬† Invest in learning them. More often than not, technical jargon and claims of \"complexity,\" especially by those in Big Tech, are meant to keep you as a passive user. They have a vested interest in keeping you from building technology. Their individual pay is economic power under Big Tech is based on scarcity and homogeneity. Above all, they want you to forget that technology is meant for human flourishing ‚Äî not capital.¬†\n\n  \nSource:\n\nBenjamin, W. (1966). The Author as Producer.

A whole lot. Like art, technology is a potent political tool. The internet and social media, tools many argue were essential to events like the Arab Spring, are widely used by governments and institutions to surveil and suppress. \n\nBefore I lose the card-carrying capitalists whose complete retort to the ideas of Marx and Hegel is \"communism never worked,\" none understood capitalism, its tensions and shortcomings better than them. Furthermore, Marx, in particular, was acutely aware of the ability of capitalism to co-opt efforts to change it. This is particularly important. \nThe programmer, therefore, has political power as the producer of technology. Benjamin‚Äôs method and theory form the basis of a similar politically oriented and materially rooted theory of programmer and technology, which I begin here.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\nSpecifically, my goal is to provide a framework to understand the political power of the programmer as a producer of technology, drawing from Benjamin's analogous theory developed in Author as Producer.¬† I begin by motivating and explaining Benjamin's concept of ‚Äútechnique.‚Äù Like Benjamin, I adopt a materialist lens which means I focus on how modern-day technology is produced, so I define Open Source and Big Tech, as the two ‚Äúmeans of production‚Äù. Employing Benjamin's analogous analysis of the newspaper, I argue that the emancipatory potential of Open Source lies in its technique, which, unlike the technique of Big Tech, weakens the distinction between user and producer. Finally, I conclude that Open Source, even as it interacts with Big Tech and capital, has the emancipatory potential to democratize programming, empowering communities to shape the technology rather than let it be shaped by the incentives of capital.¬†","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:33:43.882233102Z","tags":[]}}
