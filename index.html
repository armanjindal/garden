<a href=/quartz/digital-garden/Questions/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/digital-garden/Questions/>questions</a> that I have.</p><a href=#-the-garden-metaphor><h2 id=-the-garden-metaphor><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🪴 The Garden Metaphor</h2></a><p>Maggie Appleton defines a digital garden in
<a href=https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history rel=noopener>A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren&rsquo;t strictly organised by their publication date. They&rsquo;re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren&rsquo;t refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They&rsquo;re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we&rsquo;re used to seeing.</p></blockquote><p>While this is a good starting point, I find the metaphor of &ldquo;garden&rdquo; is much richer.</p><p>Gardens have this primordial association as a place of <em>creation</em>. Unlike blogs which are comprised of distinct, complete, static, and organized entities, gardens are comprised of a growing network of plants connected in soil. Thinking of writing as gardening helps me conceptualize the act of writing as a radically incremental one. <strong>It isn&rsquo;t heroic or final.</strong> One is never <em>done</em> working on their garden. That would be ridiculous.</p><p>It is my hope to create something that is <em>alive</em>. The best gardens have &ldquo;life.&rdquo; Call it vibes, a feeling, energy, juju: it is that intangible but real feeling we get from certain places, people things. &ldquo;Life&rdquo; emerges at an untraceable point in the development of a system. Interestingly its presence isn&rsquo;t always recognized, but its absence is.</p><p>To be clear, I know there isn&rsquo;t much of that here <em>yet</em>. This is early. Most of my pieces are <em>saplings.</em> Expect some typos, incomplete sentences, and notes with little structure. The writing here isn&rsquo;t my considered &ldquo;final&rdquo; opinion. In fact, I expect over the course of my life, most pages will die. This is good.</p><p>Ideas are helpful insofar as they lead to <strong>life</strong>: action, community, flourishing, and further questions. &ldquo;Bad ideas&rdquo; are anything that distracts the energy and attention that the best ideas demand. In this context, I am the measure of"good" and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and much like myself, I am only sure that it will change over time. Exposing my thoughts on the page as clearly as possible will help me test theory against <em>reality</em>, unafraid to modify, discard, and eradicate the bad.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t started this garden to be <em>right</em>. It is an elaborate forcing mechanism to work in public, build a second brain, and write. It&rsquo;s a long-term project to reap the compounding benefits of knowledge, form and find community, and a platform to express myself with greater control of the medium than social media.</p><p>Through consistent <em>gardening</em>, I hope to plant a few solid trees, nourished by the sunlight and the scrutiny of my readers. In the face of the confusing, contingent, and cruelly indifferent world, I believe that Voltaire offers a compelling response in the pithy concluding line of <em>Candide</em>:</p><blockquote><p><a href=https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/ rel=noopener>&ldquo;Il faut cultiver notre jardin.&rdquo;</a> — Voltaire</p></blockquote><p>Cultivating this garden by writing every day grounds me in this Voltairian wisdom. This garden — the few thoughts, ideas, books, and media I&rsquo;ve decided to care about — is my response to an overwhelming infinity of information, suffering, and possibility.</p><p>This garden is my earnest love letter to ideas that <em>perfect is the enemy of the good</em>, the <em><a href=https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/ rel=noopener>unreasonable effectiveness of showing up every day</a></em>, and the approach to creativity that begins with unabashed unoriginal work by
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_Like_an_Artist rel=noopener>stealing like an artist</a>. It is a living polemic against finality, the static and passive. Cultivating this garden is an affirmation of my limited agency, and through it I seek to share what I find beautiful, inspiring, and interesting with people in my life.</p><p>The writing here, the plants growing in this garden, are not isolated, but neither are they neatly connected. They exist rooted in soil, connect by by a rhizome — a tangled mass of subterrean roots. My goal is to make connections between writing as explicit as possible: tracing the genealogy, connections, and changes to my writing over time is quite selfishly a fascinating project of self-examination.</p><p>To support this lofty goal, I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack to build this site. I use
<a href=https://obsidian.md/ rel=noopener>Obsidian</a> to write — a
<a href=/quartz/digital-garden/Independent-Study/Power-Power-User-Prospectus/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/digital-garden/Independent-Study/Power-Power-User-Prospectus/>power user native</a>, personal knowledge management note editor with a graph view displaying the &rsquo;links&rsquo; between pages. I publish this site using an open source built by
<a href=https://jzhao.xyz/ rel=noopener>Jacky Zhao</a> called
<a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz#quartz rel=noopener>Quartz</a> which compiles my local Obsidian vault into a Hugo site. All the pages are in <code>markdown</code> and versioned on GitHub, so there is a permanent, timestamped, line-by-line record of every change. I hope to look back at the commit histories to understand how my thinking changes. These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts, which ultimately help me shape, affirm and faithfully <strong>live</strong> a narrative of my creation.</p><a href=#-community><h2 id=-community><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🚀 Community</h2></a><p>Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its &ldquo;life.&rdquo; To do this, I will use
<a href=https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io rel=noopener>GitHub</a>, which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use it to write.</p><p>Right now, there are two ways:</p><ol><li>Feedback. You often need to review the code to merge a development branch into the main branch. This functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues rel=noopener>Issues</a>. On the <code>Issues</code> tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I aim to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I&rsquo;ve even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write.</li><li>(TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel.</li></ol><p>Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it to &ldquo;cultivate my garden&rdquo; best I can. 🪴</p><h2 id=-who-am-ihttpsyoutubefr5-x7v7uket37>🧐
<a href="https://youtu.be/fR5-x7v7UkE?t=37" rel=noopener>Who Am I?</a></h2><p>My name is Arman Jindal. I was born in Los Angeles, USA in the last month of millenia and moved to Pune, India, when I was seven. I was educated in Pune, in the International Baccalaureate (IB), until I moved to New York for college in 2018. I am in the final semester of my undergraduate at Columbia College, studying a combination track of Computer Science (CS) & Philosophy. I built my major through the CS department, joining several classes from philosophy, computer science, formal linguistics, and the history of science and technology, around the theme which I have retroactivley come to understand as the relationship between
<a href=/quartz/digital-garden/College-Language-Computation/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/digital-garden/College-Language-Computation/>Language & Computation</a>. I modified my major (much to the annoyance but kindness of my academic advisor) semester since junior year in response to changing interests and to take the best classes professors were offering that semester.</p><p>I work as a Peer Writing Fellow at the
<a href=https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/node/4083 rel=noopener>Columbia University Writing Center</a>, where I work one-on-one in hour long sessions with writers from the Columbia community. Working on a single piece of writing, we try to help move writers to the next stage in their writing process and develop them as writers using research-based methods. I am not an authority but an attentive and curious reader. I am amazed by the incredible work of my peers and am thrilled to be a small part of bringing their ideas to life. Finding
