I am in New York City. Its a privilege. A bloody expensive one. I am adjusting to adult life here; the cities different when you aren't a student. New York is a hard place to call home. I love it. I also hate it. 

I fee taunted by all the possibility. It seems to exacerbate the human condition — loneliness surrounded by people, boredom amidst endless possibility.

Travel changes me. It makes me more open and curious. I end up having more, and frankly better, conversations. Travel like anything wonderful can become an escapist. 

What about travel makes this possible? The obvious answers — new place, 

There's a few subtler reasons why times of travel can be transformative. Importantly they don't require travel
- Minimalism: 

There's no room to clean, kitchen to organize, I am constrained materially by the few things in my backpack. Travel comes with a clearing of the psychological obligations we feel to former selves. Selves which we were more energetic and motivated when they made a promise to 

removes the psychological overhead of stuff. The overwhelming amount of stuff. Stuff which requires upkeep. The lightness creates the conditions of possibility. 

- Dependence: 

When you travel you are more dependent. On the city for understandable public transit, the kindness of strangers, the recommendations of the cute barista. 

- Independence and connection are in tension with one another. Technology that makes us more independent (i.e Google Maps) for directions, (Google Reviews) for a place to eat. We evolved to be social, precisely *because* we are not independent. 


In summary, if you're want to slip into travller mode at home, lighten up, plan less, leave your phone at home, and ask for some directions.
