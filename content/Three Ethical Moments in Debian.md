Ongoing notes on [Gabriella (Biella) Coleman's](https://gabriellacoleman.org/) dissertation on the dynamic ethical and motives of Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) developers through a case study of Debian.




Part One: Debian and its Social Organization=


> "While the Berkley Unix gurus accepted contributions from those who were not already participating on the project, it was difficult to pierce the inner circle of authority and become an actual member of the team. This, from the point of view of the developers participating in the \[Debian] round-table, produced an unacceptable form of project participation, characterized by a degraded elitism that failed to equalize the terrain on which developers could prove their worth. As I discuss elsewhere (Coleman 2005), the F/OSS hacker system of meritocracy compels individuals to release the fruits of their labor in order to constantly equalize the conditions for production so that others can engage in the life-long project of technical self-cultivation within a community of peers.

- Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, was able to uniquely "harness the power of individuality to produce a distribution that far exceeded the contributions of any single person." (pg 13)
