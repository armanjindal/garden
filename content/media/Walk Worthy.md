Essay by Eloghosa Osunde [Walk Worthy](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2022/03/18/walk-worthy/)

> So there was me, always—on the way to class, in the shower, on the bus, in my room, in my sleep—reciting it to myself, confessing it over and over in my head: _Walk worthy. Walk worthy. Walk worthy._ 

> When I fell short of what I thought that meant, the whips I sent to my back were fearfully and wonderfully made. I’d left church—the place that made that kind of thinking possible—for a reason, but some of the lessons stayed. When I started writing my way toward the freedom that’s now mine, it was because I wouldn’t have survived otherwise. I was coming from a life of “must” and “should”; such teachers those words are, reminders that letters can keep you stuck, can make it too hard for you to show yourself mercy, and that we die without mercy.

> You breathe better, I’ve found, when you remember that you don’t need to go through a thousand divorces from the selves you want to leave behind: you can just accept them. Most of what we fear and regret gets bored and floats off if we just look at it, anyway.

> Ever since I was born people have decided for me what is like me and what is not, what is beneath me and what is too good for me, what I do and don’t deserve based on who they hope I am. For a while, this helped me. Being _trusted_ to be good helped me carry myself with what people refer to as dignity, which in turn opened certain doors for me—because good behavior is, after all, currency. But as the years have swelled, as the hourglasses do their thing, I realize that the people who define me in absolutes have begun to grate on me in unbearable ways. What used to free me is now a trap; what was once a long corridor for me to stroll down is now an obstacle, the thing standing in my way. Some people want me maskless and _consistent_. Others want me masked and omissive. 


>  My favorite art wakes all my senses. My favorite kind of people whisper to my life through their life: Forget fitting the mold or being correct, just be, just be, just _be_.
