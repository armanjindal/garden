Updated September, 8th 2023:

-  Starting a four-month (post-graduation) sabbatical (September ‚Äî January) where I will be traveling. Starting in the Netherlands and ending in India. I'll be writing a travel "museletter" [here](https://world.hey.com/arman.jindal) ‚Äî subscribe to follow along. 
- Creating a "mapplication" üó∫Ô∏è to show events/real-time data "near me." As a backpacker in new places. I am asking people for recommendations. The best are "events." building on top of it to discover people, places, and events on the move. 
- I write here every day. 
- No YouTube. The site has introduced TikTok-like shorts, and they are addictive. My compromise is to download anything I want to watch on 4kVideoDownloader, to prevent the mindless scroll. 

Upcoming Events:
- 10-day Vipassana meditation in Shelburne Falls,¬†Massachusetts (September 20th - October 1st) at [Dhamma DharƒÅ](https://dhara.dhamma.org/) ‚úÖ
- [RailsWorld](https://rubyonrails.org/world) Conference October 5-6 in Amsterdam ‚úÖ
