- Returned to NYC, hustling, building connections, and learning. My focus is finding a full time role where I can learn and grow technically and personally. 
- Building an open source map of NYC that is updated in real-time with all the events happening in this crazy city. Event aggregation and planning meeting mapping leveraging NLP/LLM tech so I know what do when I'm done coding for the day. 
- Writing and coding every day â€”Â by pushing a [[daily commit]]. 
- Creating a community of technologists, writers, artists through dinner parties and events
