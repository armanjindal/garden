- Building a social map that shows the "life" in NYâ€”Â gigs, street artists' performances, farmers' markers â€” near you in time and space! Think Google Maps "cafes near me" meets RA and that community event board built in the 90s. Shoot me an email if you'd like to be an early tester.

- Talking to people and exploring opportunities to build things that create real value with incredible people who are learners and teachers.
