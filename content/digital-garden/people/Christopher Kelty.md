> But even this capitalism enthusiasm was tempered by the many things the internet still could have been. Even doused in lubricant, it was still an artistic medium, a hive mind, a multiplayer game, a playing field leveller, and a destroyer of old Idols, whether of the market, the university or the government. The internet we could have had was a haven for hackers and activists, legal scholars and (digital) anthropologists, net.artists and music pirates, cultural critics and journalists, meme-makers and [Anonymous](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2027-hacker-hoaxer-whistleblower-spy).

> It happened around the time that I would have written that book. In 2012, Snowden’s [revelations](https://github.com/iamcryptoki/snowden-archive) simultaneously changed the Internet from a utopian dream that no one really took seriously, to a dystopian reality that everyone did. It did not happen overnight: it took smartphones in everyone’s pocket, an exhausting war on terror, and an epic financial crisis, but it was nonetheless a moment of transition. Did the internet cause these things? Probably not, though it is hard to disentangle the rise of high-frequency internet trading from the financial crisis, or the availability of open and secure communication tools from Occupy or Arab Spring or the renewed total surveillance power of the NSA from the War on Terror. Neither the internet we could have had nor the one we do have is ever just one thing.
