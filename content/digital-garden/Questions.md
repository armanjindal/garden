- **What makes some a "*mystic*"?**

Walter Benjamin, Simone Weil, philosophers, thinkers, and writers I love who are often labeled as "mystics."? How? Can I become one? I'm so far from being mystical, though! Is it because the ideas they are expressing are **inexpressible** (which is to say require direct experience)? 

If that's the case, then underlying our unease with the term is the assumption that: 
1. Language is sufficient to capture and convey all experiences (!)
2. Therefore we think we can "read" ourselves to Enlightenment (!)

What a terribly stultifying and wrong assumptions. Then we could just hook ourselves up to an IV drip of information. What about wordless wisdom? Wisdom you see people embody through action and life. Or concepts for which we merely lack the conceptual and actual apparatus to measure and understand. Its the ultimate confusion of the map with the territory. Words are map. Life is territory. 

- "**What's your type?**"

Right now (romantic) relationship are the meat of most conversations. In them this question is often asked. We are expected to give a physical profile and list a few personality traits humorously. Every failed relationship gets us closer to our knowing our "type" until ... happily ever after (of course!)

The honest answer: I don't know. However, underlying this question is an assumption that my "true" personality exists distinctly from theirs. It posits two distinct selves. That's a useful concept to use in most day to day life, but I want to push against in (romantic) relationships. Because it locates the force attraction entirely *in someone else* and ignores the lived reality that I am so different with different people. 

My cheeky response right now inverts this. My type are people when who when I am around, I turn into a version of myself that I am most attracted to. Sounds pretty narcissistic I know. But I'd argue its *less* narcissistic than the thought that **you** are *not influenced* by the person you are with and the environment you are in. 

My type: the person who elicits the version of me I most like — at the time ;)
