- **What makes some a "*mystic*"?**

Walter Benjamin, Simone Weil, philosophers, thinkers, and writers I love who are often labeled as "mystics."? How? Can I become one? I'm so far from being mystical, though! Is it because the ideas they are expressing are **inexpressible** (which is to say require direct experience)? Why do we think we can "read" ourselves to Enlightenment? What a terribly stultifying life. Then we could just hook ourselves up to an IV drip of information. What about wordless wisdom? Or concepts for which we merely lack the conceptual and actual apparatus to measure and understand. 

- **What's my/your type?**

This often gets asked by friends about potential partners. The honest answer. I don't know. Underlying this question is an assumption that me (an entirely) distinct from them am attracted to them. It locates the force attraction entirely *in someone else*. My cheeky response right now, which inverts this. My type are people when who when I am around, I turn into a person who I am attracted to. When, based on them and our relation, they elicit the parts of me that are the best ones.
