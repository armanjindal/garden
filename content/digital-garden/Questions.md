- **What makes some a "*mystic*"?**

Walter Benjamin, Simone Weil, philosophers, thinkers, and writers I love who are often labeled as "mystics."? How? Can I become one? I'm so far from being mystical, though! Is it because the ideas they are expressing are **inexpressible** (which is to say require direct experience)? Why do we think we can "read" ourselves to Enlightenment? What a terribly stultifying life. Then we could just hook ourselves up to an IV drip of information. What about wordless wisdom? Or concepts for which we merely lack the conceptual and actual apparatus to measure and understand.
