title: "Language Matters"

Because it does, and my dear friend [Isabelle Pride]() says so. Jokes. 

But it does. Most fundamentally. Language is how we construct reality and our self-concept. Using it well, in full recognition of its expressive limitations, is an excercise agency in constructing reality.  

I don't have a coherent theory of cognition and language, and there is plenty of crazy dense philosophical and psychological work on this topic. I am not going to summarize it or even explain it. My goal here is to make a case for its **intentional use.** 

My main argument here calls for your active experimentation. I know. Work, ugh. Do you mean I can't just read more books? I know this epistemology of self-experimentation might rub some straw man ivory tower academics the wrong way or piss off that annoying, hyper-empirical scientific friend we all have who needs a randomized, double-blind, control study on the best way to wipe their ass, but trust me. The most important truths about how to live your life are best answered by intentional and aware experimentation. 

Find a word/phrase/metaphor you often use, interrogate it, and then find something better. Then challenge yourself to use the new phrase/word instead of the old. Notice when you do how you feel. Note down the situations 

Whether it is a predisposition to apologize when it isn't your fault, or a category you use to counterproductively and limits your understanding of yourself, take a moment to find a better word or phrase. One that closely aligns with who you want to be and how you want to construct reality. Language is the location of the agency. Let's pay attention to what words and metaphors we use. If language is the "limits" of my world, better words can literally mean, vaster life. I hope you give it a try. Here is a running list of my language interventions for some inspiration:

Thoughts on Words:

> "Community" and "spam" are \[...] outstanding examples of words as places rather than fixed objects, that is zones where we can meet and negotiate about meaning. These words act as an open space for the movements of great powers and agendas, as well as small roving groups of actors.  "Community" enables conversation about its meaning.

- Kind of like the word "American" :)
