title: "Apartment Sublet - September - December/January, 2023"
---

I am subletting my room in a three bedroom two bathroom apartment in [515 West, 110th Street](https://goo.gl/maps/8XZnHx7jWGRHDpTW6). 

I LOVE this room, apartment, my roommates, and area. I am looking for someone who will fit in and enjoy here while I backpack. Ideally, I am looking for a whole semester. I am flexible exact start dates and can pro-rate, but at minimum three months.

- It's a spacious, furnished room with an A/C, window and private en suite bathroom.
- Very close to Columbia, a two min walk from 1 - 110th Street station and 7 min walk to the C. Right next to KMart & Westside Market (24 hours), and near the Hungarian Pastry shop.
- The common space + kitchen are furnished and stocked. There is plenty of cupboard space and fridge space. We are a house of cookers, and often hosted dinner parties and all cooked together with up to 15 people. 
- Excellent roommates. They are honestly so great its sad to leave. [Coby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cobysimler?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is a PM at Brex and graduated from Columbia in '22 and [David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Oks) is a journalist and hedge fund fixer who graduated from Oxford last year. 
- Lots of storage (two full cupboards)
- Price: $1950/Month (not including utilities and WiFi)
- Dates: September - December
