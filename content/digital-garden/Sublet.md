title: "Apartment Sublet - September - December/January, 2023"
---

I am subletting my room in a three bedroom apartment in 515 West, 110th Street. 

I LOVE this room, apartment, and area. I am looking for someone who will fit in here and enjoy living here while I backpack and hunt for a job. Ideally, it is for a whole semester. I am flexible on dates, but at minimum three months. Open to discuss an exact day and pro-rate accordingly. 

- It's a spacious, furnished room with an A/C and window. 
- Very close to Columbia, a two min walk from 1 - 110th Street station and 7 min walk to the C.
- The common space + kitchen are furnished and stocked. There is plenty of cupboard space and fridge space. We are a house of cookers, and often hosted dinner parties and all cooked together with up to 15 people. 
- Excellent roommates. They are honestly so great its sad to leave. Coby is a PM at Brex and graduated from Columbia in '22 and David is a journalist and hedge fund fixer who graduated from Oxford last year. 
- Private bathroom in the room. 
- Lots of storage (two full cupboards)
- Price: $1950/Month (not including utilities and WiFi)
- Dates: September - January 

Let me know if you're interested — arman.jindal@hey.com — or through whoever sent this to you. I'll take this down when its filled.
