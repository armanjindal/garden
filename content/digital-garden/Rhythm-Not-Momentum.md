title: "Find Rhythm. Not Momentum"

---
Momentum measures how hard it is to stop something once it is in motion. The metaphor of momentum is used (and abused!) everywhere, from sports and entrepreneurship to working out and relationships. Momentum has gone from a descriptive physical quantity to a constructive mental model we use to conceptualize ourselves in the world. 

I've always had a toxic relationship with momentum. Momentum can work for you as much as it can against you. To quote a Nike commercial that used to be my alarm clock when I was an elite junior squash payer, ["momentum is a cruel mistress. It will turn on you in a dime."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmkNKEHC8Pg)

When you've got "momentum," you feel invincible. The "weight" of the previous productive days or previous workouts helps "push" you through the one in front of you. The feeling of momentum often comes with improvement. Don't break the streak is a powerful motivator. When you are in it, it feels great.

The other side is cruel. Because eventually, life happens. A family trip "gets in the way" of your workout program or writing streak. You've had a massive cheat meal on a night out with friends. You've lost "momentum." All the "weight" you once had working for you is now gone. You've lost something that isn't tangible but feels very real. This feeling has often led me into a destructive, unproductive spiral. This is a metaphor worth looking at closer.  

"Momentum" evokes the image of a rock rolling down the mountain. It **requires immense effort** to begin, but once it rolls, you better get out of the way. As the boulder tumbles down the mountain, you better get out of the way or catch up. Momentum is a vector, which means it has a magnitude as well as direction. It is always "going" somewhere.

Now, metaphors are never perfect. But I've got a better one. *Rhythm*. 

Everyone needs to find their own, and this can change with time. Losing your rhythm isn't quite the same as breaking your momentum. As a beginner dancer, I know you can recover it as quickly as you lost it. The best way to do that is the get back to the present moment and let the music wash over you. 

Once you've found a rhythm, it becomes easier to stay in it. So it captures the same benefits of consistency, but unlike momentum (which goes to 0 the moment you stop), rhythm has a funny way of getting into your bones. At some point, it becomes who you are, and how delightful that it can change in an instant. 

The metaphor of "rhythm" evokes the image of **dance**. This brings me to my favorite part about this metaphor. Rhythm makes space for others. The right partner brings another "rhythm" to your life. One that changes yours enough but lets you keep dancing. When your rhythms sync up, they interact constructively. You can do things together that you couldn't without them. More generally, unlike the solitary rock tumbling down the mountain, your social relations are not "in your way," but the right ones expand the realm possible. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I want friends and partners with whom I can dance: where our rhythm mutually influences each other, occasionally sync, leading to those emotions and feelings of well-being you can only get from being a part of bigger than yourself.

"Rhythm," isn't directional. You don't **have** to be going somewhere. Finding a rhythm can  help get to where you want to go (think rowing/military marching), but a deeper intention about how you are in the world. Interestingly in surmounts the distinction between what you are and where you are going. Rhythm at once is a moment-to-moment, but it also communicates a fair bit about where you are going.

Finally, the metaphor captures the dynamism of being. Rather than conceptualizing ourselves as static entities with singular directions (rock with momentum), rhythm is a metaphor that celebrates our constant movement. To live is to be moved. Moved by the people, landscapes, art, nauture, and in turn to influence the people and situations we bring into our lives. 

So when I next feel that tailwind of compounded consistency, instead of saying I've "got momentum", I will say, "I've found a *rhythm*." I hope I've convinced you to do the same. If you got a better word — let me know!
