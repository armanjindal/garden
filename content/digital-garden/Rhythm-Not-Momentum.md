Momentum measures how hard it is to stop something once it is in motion. The metaphor of momentum is used (and abused!) everywhere, from sports and entrepreneurship to working out and relationships. Momentum is one of those metaphors that has gone from a descriptive physical quantity to a constructive mental-model of the world. 

I've always had a love/hate relationship with momentum. I'm sure I am not alone, since ,omentum can work for you as much as it can work against you. To quote a Nike commercial that use to be my alarm clock at a particulary "grind-set" point in my life - 

When you've got "momentum," you feel invincible. The "weight" of the previous productive days or previous workouts helps "push" you through the one in front of you. The feeling of momentum often comes with improvement. Don't break the streak is a powerful motivator. 

Momentum can also be quite cruel. Because eventually, life happens. A family trip "gets in the way" of your workout program. You've had a massive cheat meal on a night out with friends. You've lost momentum. All the "weight" you once had working for you is now gone. You must work hard to build this momentum again. I've always felt that  As a former elite junior athlete and presently highly ambitious person, this feeling of guilt and failure is a destructive, unproductive spiral I've felt many times. 

"Momentum" evokes the image of a rock rolling down the mountain. It **requires immense effort** to begin, but once it rolls, you better get out of the way. As the boulder tumbles down the mountain, it's got **direction**.  Momentum is a vector, which means it has a magnitude as well as direction. It is always "going" somewhere.

Now, metaphors are never perfect. But I've got a better one. *Rhythm*. 

Everyone needs to find their own, and this can change with time. Losing your rhythm isn't quite the same as breaking your momentum. You can recover it as quickly as you lost it. When you are "in" a rhythm, it becomes easier to stay in it. So it captures the same benefits of consistency, but unlike momentum (which goes to 0 the moment you stop), rhythm has a funny way of getting into your bones. 

"Rhythm" evokes the image of dance. This brings me to my favorite part about this metaphor. Rhythm makes space for others. The right partner brings another "rhythm" to your life. One that changes yours enough but lets you keep dancing. When your rhythms sync up, they interact constructively. You can do things together you couldn't alone. More generally, unlike the solitary rock tumbling down the mountain, your social relations are not "in your way," but the right ones expand what is possible. 

With "rhythm," you don't **have** to be going somewhere. Finding a rhythm, a cadence can seriously help (think rowing), but ultimately your important habits are decisions about how you want to be in the world. Your identity. 

Sure, you can build "momentum" for a habit of workout out if you want to look great without your shirt off in the summer, but this is different if you have a life-long commitment to caring for and experiencing the full extent of your physicality. The latter is an outcome-based goal rather than an identity one. In this case, you want to change your rhythm - you want to change you. 

Finally, the metaphor captures the dynamism of being. Rather than conceptualizing ourselves as static entities with singular directions (rock with momentum), we choose a metaphor that celebrates our constant movement - influenced by the people and situations we bring into our lives. 

This is why I will say, when I'm feeling a tailwind wind, I've found a "rhythm" - not that I got "momentum. "
