## üìö education
I was born in Los Angeles in the last month of the second millennium. At seven, I moved to Pune, India. I attended an International Baccalaureate (IB) school and played [competitive squash](https://youtu.be/BZ3n9XHfAy8?t=1637) until I moved to New York to attend Columbia University in 2018. 

I graduated from Columbia College with a joint major in Computer Science & Philosophy. I built my major through the CS department, joining several classes from philosophy, computer science, formal linguistics, and the history of science and technology around "Language & Computation." I study how language shapes the **imagination** of the "self"  in the context of the history of the computer and the internet. This culminated in a self-driven (still in progress) thesis on [Power & Power User](digital-garden/technology/Independent%20Study/Power%20&%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md). I modified my major every semester since junior year in response to changing interests and to study with the best professors teaching that semester (much to the annoyance but kindness of my academic advisor, [Luis Gravano]()). Here's the [track course list](media/columbia-cs-track.pdf) approved by the CS department for my CS-Philosophy track. 

## üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª work
Professionally, I value "People, Ideas, and Things" in that order. 

In my junior year, I moved to Berlin for the summer to work as a software engineer intern at [Airy](https://airy.co/), an open-source, real-time data integration company. My contributions are on GitHub [here](https://github.com/airyhq/airy/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+author%3Aarmanjindal). 

In my senior year, I worked part-time as a Peer Writing Fellow at the [Columbia University Writing Center](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/node/4083).  I worked with over 75 writers in one-on-one, hour-long sessions using research-based writing studies methods to help them move to the next stage in their writing process. I had no "official authority" but was an attentive and curious reader. This was some of the most gratifying work I have ever done. Being a small part of bringing writers' ideas to life was an honor. Finding [the right words](digital-garden/philosophy/Jugaad%20and%20the%20Power%20of%20the%20Right%20Word.md) to express yourself is both empowering and world-shaping. I want to thank the best bosses: [Sue Mendelsohn](https://english.columbia.edu/content/sue-mendelsohn) & [Jason Ueda](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/uwp/writing-center/consultants#JasonU), and my incredible friend, who introduced me to this world, [Isabelle Pride](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellepride/).

After graduating in May 2023, I worked as a summer intern on the DevOps team at [37signals](https://37signals.com/), the makers of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and [Hey](https://www.hey.com/).  It was immensely challenging and rewarding. I joined the team at the tail end of an [exciting migration off-cloud](https://basecamp.com/cloud-exit). The intensity was palpable. Every day, I learned so much: Ruby, Rails, Chef, Kamal, Docker, bash scripting, OS commands, general troubleshooting, and more. During our interview, I asked [Eron](https://dev.37signals.com/author/eron/), my mentor, manager, and the Director of Ops, what he thinks about declarative vs. imperative infrastructure tools. After thinking about and working on the team for three months, I answered my question through [a blog post](https://dev.37signals.com/leaning-imperative/)¬†on the 37signals dev blog!

In addition to learning an immense amount about Ops, I was mentored by the 37signals crew. From design and product to finance and customer service. Because of how we use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), I could see the other teams working. I set up 1:1s across the company. I met some of the kindest, most intelligent people. 

In particular, the writing and design culture spoke to me. I've dived deep by taking [Edward Tufte's](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) seminar and improving my "front-end" skills. 

**üó∫Ô∏è What's next?**
I want to build something I am proud of as I travel for the next four months. I ‚ù§Ô∏è maps, so stay tuned. 

I want to work more closely with users and designers as an engineer. I am seeking a position in New York or remote, starting in January 2024. I want to build technology with incredible people who value learning, community, and clear writing and who are creating technology that empowers its users' ability to shape the world. I am generally not interested in fintech(blockchain), AI for the sake of using AI, selling ads, infringing user privacy, and military. 
## üöÄ life
So much of this garden reflects how I live. I enjoy dancing and working out(doors). I need to exercise, read, and write every day. Here are some [rules](digital-garden/My%20Rules%20for%20Sanity%20&%20Happiness.md) I try to live by and [Tools](digital-garden/Tools.md) I use. I am an essentialist trying to eliminate everything distracting me from what matters. I strive to open myself to being moved by people, experiences, and art. I love to [travel](digital-garden/travel%20and%20life%20journal/Travel.md) light, cheap, and with a friend (or make 'em on the way!). I took a gap year during covid where I lived in Goa, got into Conversational AI, and  [climbed a mountain] in Leh, India. Parts of me are always with my friends and family, who inspire me every day.
