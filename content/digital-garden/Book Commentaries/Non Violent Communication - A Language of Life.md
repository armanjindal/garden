	- Example of lousy gratitude:
		- "You are brilliant" - there is no information here. 
		- On the contrary, being told what you are is dangerous. It's a reductive box that does not help but holds you to some standard. 
	- To express gratitude well:
		- 1. Bring to the person's attention **concretely** what they did that that **made life more wonderful** 
		- 2. Say what you *feel* at the moment about the person who has *done that*. 
		- 3. Say what *need* of yours is met by the other person's actions. 
	- To receive gratitude well:
		- For some (Jackals), nothing is scarier than receiving honest and sincere appreciation.
		- Automatic Response: "It's nothing" that comes from:
			- A narrative of "deserving." I do not deserve this. 
			- A need for "humility" (that is based on hubris)
				- BUT: "Don't be so humble. You are not that great." 
				- By accepting someone's gratitude for your actions, you acknowledge you are not above it. You are 
	- Overall, gratitude should come from the HEART to CELEBRATE LIFE. 
	- Never express gratitude to praise, compliment, or reward for any secondary benefits.
