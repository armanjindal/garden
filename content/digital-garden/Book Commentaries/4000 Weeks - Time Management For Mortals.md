title: "4000 Weeks: Time Management For Mortals"
---
My tongue-in-cheek one-liner for this book is the "anti-productivity anti-self-help productivity self-help book" we all need. [Oliver Burkeman] does so well, bringing ancient and philosophical ideas into an area we must think more deeply about in our time. He does it in a way that is useful and accessible.  This book touches on many disparate intuitions and bits of wisdom in an organized, coherent way. Reading, listening and re-reading this book has tangibly improved my life and happiness in ways that I will try to capture here. The prose is straightforward in a sobering way but entertaining way. Burkeman's stakes here are quite literally life and death. 

The Efficiency Trap:
- The more (unquestioningly) efficient you become, the more likely you are to take on the tasks that others ask of you to make their lives easier rather than enrich your life. 
- WHY?
	- Because the optimal time management strategy **promises** that you will take on more of these commitments.
	- It's a delusional escape from the constraints of your time and energy. 
	- We much rather think this than confront the harsh and brutal indifferent limits of our existence.
