title: "4000 Weeks: Time Management For Mortals"
---
My tongue-in-cheek one-liner for this book is the "anti-productivity, anti-self-help productivity self-help book."

The Efficiency Trap:
- The more (unquestioningly) efficient you become, the more likely you are to take on the tasks that others ask of you to make their lives easier rather than enrich your life. 
- WHY?
	- Because the optimal time management strategy **promises** that you will take on more of these commitments.
	- It's a delusional escape from the constraints of your time and energy. 
	- We much rather think this than confront the harsh and brutal indifferent limits of our existence. 

"The more wonderful experiences you succeed in having, the more additional experiences you feel like you *could have* or *ought to have* on top of all the experiences you already have."
