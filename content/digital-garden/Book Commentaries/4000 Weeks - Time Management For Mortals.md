title: "4000 Weeks: Time Management For Mortals"
---

My tongue-in-cheek one-liner for this book is the "anti-productivity anti-self-help productivity self-help book" I didn't know I needed. [Oliver Burkeman] combines ancient and philosophical ideas in a lucid meditation on our relationship with time. He does it in a way that is useful and accessible but well-researched and honest. This book brings many disparate intuitions and bits of wisdom into an organized, coherent narrative. Our cultural obsession withÂ mastery and total control of our time total control over it is not possible or desirable. This is only painful until we recognize that it couldn't be any other way.

Reading, listening to, and re-reading this book has made me happier and my life better.  I've often returned to it when my anxieties, often time-related,  begin to constrict my chest. 

The prose is straightforward in a sobering way but entertaining way. Burkeman doesn't shy away from sharing his changing relationship: from a recovering productivity nerd to a new father. His struggles with times are shared by all of us living in this particular moment in time, where time is conceptualized separately from ourselves and an instrument to be used "well." Burkman has a convincing case that the stakes of his project are quite literally life and death. 

Below you will find notes on chapters that I've returned to, and felt compelled to write about. 

Being & Time:


The Efficiency Trap:
- The more (unquestioningly) efficient you become, the more likely you are to take on the tasks that others ask of you to make their lives easier rather than enrich your life. 
- WHY?
	- Because the optimal time management strategy **promises** that you will take on more of these commitments.
	- It's a delusional escape from the constraints of your time and energy. 
	- We much rather think this than confront the harsh and brutal indifferent limits of our existence. 

"The more wonderful experiences you succeed in having, the more additional experiences you feel like you *could have* or *ought to have* on top of all the experiences you already have."
