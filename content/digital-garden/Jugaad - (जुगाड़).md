One of my favorite things to talk about right now is language. [Language matters](digital-garden/Language%20Matters.md) because our intentional use in understanding ourselves and the world is one of the greatest expressions of agency. We carve up reality. We also get to change how we carve it up.

While I am not convinced of the truth of Wittgenstein's  "the limits of my language are the limits of my world," I see it as an invitation. If language limits are one of the limiting factors of my "world," my response: "expand it." 

So often, I ask friends who speak a language other than English: what is your favorite word from your language that you feel loses much of its essence when translated into English? 

I recently asked this to a half Russian 

> “Toska - noun /ˈtō-skə/ - Russian word roughly translated as sadness, melancholia, lugubriousness.  
> 
  "No single word in English renders all the shades of toska. At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases, it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.”
  ― Vladimir Nabokov


The "shades of meaning" are only real in context. 

As someone who has grown up between the US and India, in the habit of picking the best of the cultures without fully identifying as one, I feel equipped inside enough, but also outside to explain the word, and why its one of my personal favorite features of Indian and my self identified Indians. 


- I went back to India for the first time in over two years. By god did I miss driving there. 

It's one of those words you can't fully translate into another language, that tell you so much about the culture and people. 


Driving in India feels like juagaad. It is the ability to assess in a moment how a system works, assess reality, and act out the best way to accomplish your goal. 

- Sometimes (as I learned over my summer living in Germany) the best jugaad is no jugaad. 
- Much like the trickesters in world culture, jugaad is somewhat amoral. Its amoral in part because of the utility. Often the time for jugaad in a situation is instantaneous. On confronting a situation, you have to quickly, almost immediatley asses. Who is this person in front of me? Are they new? Old? On a power-trip or meek? 


- I think this amorality cuts both ways.
