- I am my enjoying my internship on the incredible DevOps team at [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). I am drinking from the firehose. I show up *excited* to work with some of the smartest, kindest people I've ever met. What an immense privilege to learn, work, build and contribute at 37signals.  It ends September 1st, 2023, and I am looking for the next thing.

Upcoming: 
- Planning a four month sabbatical after the internship until the end of December. I am looking to sublet my apartment in New York, sell everything except my books, and hit the road with a book (singular), laptop, and backpack.Let me know if you know anyone looking for a beautiful place near Columbia University. Though I will be writing, reading, programming, contributing to open source, this is an experiment in lean/minimal living. 
- I will be attending the [RailsWorld](https://rubyonrails.org/world) Conference October 5-6 in Amsterdam.
