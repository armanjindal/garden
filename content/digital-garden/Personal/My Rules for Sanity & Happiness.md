I have always had a fraught relationship with rules. So as a rule I include in any list of rules,  with  famous Orwellian caviat from his rules six rules of writing:

> ["Break any of these rules sooner than say \[or do!\] anything outright barbarous."](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/)

Finally, these are MY rules for MY life. It is a reminder of wisdom and trusism I find myself coming back to. As Thoreau puts in the introduction to Walden:

> "I trust that none will _stretch the seams_ in putting on the _coat_, for it may do good service to him whom it fits."

Rules:

1. Work out, breathe fresh air every day, and get into the sun. Lift, run, swim, climb mountains, fight, and stretch. Your body was meant to move. 

2. Care for and love your body. It is your only true home. "Spend not one more second doing anything but loving it." Be thankful for its proper function. The one thing you can be sure of, is that your body will deteriorate, and in a moment, the functions that you rely on everyday could disappear.

3. Plan your day. As a day you want to have not one you feel you ought to. Plan to the degree that you do not need to bring your phone. Even if you know it will change. Its a recognition of your limited time and energy within the 24 hours that make up the day.

4. Maintain a DONE list of everything you accomplished. Its easy to lose sight of daily work. 

5. Dress to be the person you aim to be. If we are "actors of our our own ideal" dress matters.
 
6. Watch your words. What you say shapes your reality. Words slip out in a moment but can cause everlasting damage. [Finding the Right Word](digital-garden/Finding%20the%20Right%20Word.md) is an endless game. Keep playing.

7. When you find yourself rushing. Pause. Slow Down. Take a Deep Breath. Ask yourself: what are you rushing to? Who are you rushing for? Most importantly, why are you rushing?


 8. Apologize when it matters, not as a reflex or to pass on the emotional labor to the person you wronged. 

 Case 1. You actually something wrong. 
 - Apologize as soon and precisley as possble. Take responsibility, learn, communicate and move on. 
 
Case 2. Life happened and it isn't your fault. 
- Instead of a reflexive, I'm sorry respond rather with a compassionate, collective sense of 'we are all in this together. Rather than one rooted in blame and guilt detached from reality. There isn't enough space on the subway. So we bump into eachother. Smile. Joke. Shrug your shoulders. But don't apologize. It isn't your fault. Thank someone for their patience if you are late. Ideally, don't be late. 

9. Sleep. When you don't know what to do next, you probably need to sleep. Before you get all "grindset' and cut down on sleep, eliminate everything stopping you from sleeping that you shouldn't. Especially [sleep procrastination]. You aren't even close to the point where sleeping less would make you more productive. Get the lower-hanging fruit. Workout are better, writing is better, you are happier, healthier, more creative, and open to enjoy the incredible people you are so lucky to be around. 

In the [wise words of John Mulaney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiqKK4ysI7g):
> "Do all my friends hate me or do I just need to sleep?"

10. Clear space, clean mind. Eliminate distraction and start with your physical space.  

11.  Community underlies you and you it. If you can forget your radical dependence on others, it is a function of invisible work others veiled by your unrecognized privilege. I call facile metaphysical individualism. It takes a village to raise a child. Being raised and raising others is an integral human experience. Helping others meet their needs when yours are met is a gift. Asking others to help you meet your needs (when theirs are met) is also a gift. Get better at giving help and asking for it. The only way to recognize this is to do it. Not philosophize about it (too much! - see rule 15)

12. Lift HEAVY. Sometimes you need a challenging workout that involves lifting heavy shit — especially when you're spinning your wheels mentally. Testosterone comes from winning, and there is nothing a short win like lifting something heavy. 

13. Dance. Preferably with other people. But alone too!

14. Never let intellectualism win over humanism. Read philosophy, experience art of all kinds, participate in culture, create technology and not adopt the detached, disembodied, "objective" critic nor develop into that disillusioned cynic. The hypertrophy of the intellect devours the soul. Connect with people as a person, not as products of culture. 

15. Suffering does not equal value. I feel surrounded and sometimes partake in a performative value hierarchy that equates suffering with value. It's bullshit. Learn to find pleasure — in your body, in work, with others, through music — and value it for [its own sake](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/03/body-pleasure/), not because you "endured it". There is some post-Puritan capitalist pseudo-intellectual bullshit that valorizes smartness with suffering and joy with stupidy. Thats bullshit. For the most part, as far as I can tell, it's rooted in a weird, guilt-ridden psyche that chooses facile individualism over a more complex understanding of self. At best an ok value hierarchy for work, but an utterly terrible one for connecting with other humans and enjoying life.
