title: "My Rules for Sanity & Happiness"
---
I have always had a fraught relationship with rules. So, as a rule, I include in any list of rules the  famous Orwellian caveat:

> ["Break any of these rules sooner than say \[or do!\] anything outright barbarous."](https://infusion.media/blog/george-orwells-six-rules-for-writing/)

Finally, these are MY rules for MY life. It reminds me of the wisdom and truism I find myself returning to. As Thoreau puts it in the introduction to Walden:

> "I trust that none will _stretch the seams_ in putting on the _coat_, for it may do good service to him whom it fits."

Rules:

1. Work out, breathe fresh air every day, and get into the sun. Lift, run, swim, climb mountains, fight, and stretch. Your body was meant to move. 

2. Care for and love your body. It is your only true home. "Spend not one more second doing anything but loving it." Be thankful for its functioning. The one thing you can be sure of is that your body will deteriorate, and in a moment, the functions that you rely on every day could disappear.

3. Plan your day. An day you want to have, not one you feel you feel you ought. Or worse *ought* to want to. Plan to the degree that you do not need to bring your phone. Even if you know it will change. Its a recognition of your limited time and energy within the 24 hours that make up the day. Bloody 2FA is making that hard, but I'm setting it up on my IPad.

4. Maintain a DONE list of everything you accomplished. It's easy to lose sight of everything you do and get down on yourself.  

5. Dress to be the person you aim to be if we are "actors of our own ideal," put on the right damn costume. 
 
6. Watch your words. What you say shapes your reality. Words slip out in a moment but can cause everlasting damage. [Jugaad and the Power of the Right Word](digital-garden/Jugaad%20and%20the%20Power%20of%20the%20Right%20Word.md) is an endless game. Keep playing.

7. When you find yourself rushing. Pause. Slow Down. Take a Deep Breath. Ask yourself: what are you rushing to? Who are you rushing for? Most importantly, why are you rushing?

 8. Apologize when it matters, not as a reflex or to pass on the emotional labor to the person you wronged. 

 Case 1. You actually did something wrong. 
 - Apologize as soon and precisely as possible. Take responsibility, learn, communicate, and move on. Then, and this is sometimes the hardest part, forgive yourself. 
 
Case 2. Life happened, and it isn't your fault. 
- Instead of a reflexive, I'm sorry, respond with a compassionate, collective sense of 'we are all in this together.' Rather than one rooted in blame and guilt detached from reality. There needs to be more space on the subway. So we bump into each other. Smile. Joke. Shrug your shoulders. But don't apologize. It isn't your fault. Thank someone for their patience if you are late. Ideally, don't be late. 

9. Sleep. You probably need to sleep when you don't know what to do next. Cutting down on sleep is the stupidest idea. You aren't even close to the point where sleeping less would make you more productive. Workouts are better; writing is better; you are happier, healthier, more creative, and open to enjoying the incredible people you are so lucky to be around. 

In the [wise words of John Mulaney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiqKK4ysI7g):
> "Do all my friends hate me OR DO I JUST NEED TO SLEEP?" (capitalization, mine)

10. Clean your room. Eliminate distraction and start with your physical space.  Let your home be a living testament to a mindset of [leaving no breadcrumbs](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4GJFVc6NDzQ).

11. Figure out your needs and ask others to help you meet yours — and help them meet theirs. Helping others when your needs are met is a source of joy. Remember this when you request others for help. You are giving them a gift.

12. Community underlies you and you it. If you can forget your radical dependence on others, it is a function of their invisible work veiled by your unrecognized privilege. I call it facile metaphysical individualism. It takes a village to raise a child. Being raised and raising others is an integral human experience. Helping others meet their needs when yours are met is a gift. Asking others to help you meet your needs (when theirs are met) is also a gift. Get better at giving help and asking for it. The only way to recognize this is to do it. Not philosophize about it (too much! - see rule 15)

13. Lift HEAVY. Sometimes you need a challenging workout that involves lifting heavy shit — especially when you're spinning your wheels mentally. Testosterone comes from winning, and there is nothing a short win like lifting something heavy. 

14. Dance. Preferably with other people. But alone too!

15. Cook. For yourself and for your friends. Use your hands. Connect to the place, its food, and its produce. Let your physical nourishment also nourish your soul. 

16. Humanism over intellectualism. Read philosophy, experience the arts , participate in culture, and create technology, but do not adopt the detached, disembodied, "objective" critic nor develop into that disillusioned cynic. Hypertrophy of the intellect devours the soul. Connect with people as a person, not as products of culture. 

17. Suffering does not equal value. I feel surrounded and sometimes partake in a performative value hierarchy that equates suffering with value. It's bullshit. Learn to find pleasure — in your body, in work, with others, through music — and value it for [its own sake](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/03/body-pleasure/), not because you "endured it" or "earned it." A post-Puritan pseudo-intellectual moral intuition valorizes smartness with suffering and joy with stupidy. That's bullshit. For the most part, it's rooted in a weird, guilt-ridden psychosis that chooses facile individualism over a more complex, social understanding of self. Remember when reading that most philosophers were locked in an ivory tower: friendless, physically weak, existentially distraught, and depressed.
