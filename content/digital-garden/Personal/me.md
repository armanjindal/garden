## üìö education
I was born in Los Angeles, USA, in the last month of the second millennium. I moved to Pune, India when I was seven and attended an International Baccalaureate (IB) there until I moved to New York to attend Columbia University in 2018. 

I graduated from Columbia College with a joint major in Computer Science & Philosophy. I built my major through the CS department, joining several classes from philosophy, computer science, formal linguistics, and the history of science and technology around the theme, which I have come to understand as the relationship between [Language & Computation](digital-garden/work-in-progress/College%20-%20Language%20&%20Computation.md). I studied how language shapes imagination and subjectivity, in the context of the history of the computer and internet. This culminated in a self-driven (still in progress) thesis on [Power & Power User](digital-garden/technology/Independent%20Study/Power%20&%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md). I modified my major (much to the annoyance but kindness of my academic advisor, [Luis Gravano]()) every semester since junior year in response to changing interests and to study with the best professors teaching that semester. Here's the [final elective course list](media/columbia-cs-track.pdf) approved by the CS department for my CS-Philosophy track. 

## üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª work
Professionally, I value "People, Ideas, and Things" in that order. 

In my junior year, I moved to Berlin over the summer and worked as a software engineer intern at [Airy](https://airy.co/), an open-source data real-time data integration company. My contributions are on Github, [here](https://github.com/airyhq/airy/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+author%3Aarmanjindal). 

In my senior year, I worked part-time as a Peer Writing Fellow at the [Columbia University Writing Center](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/node/4083).  I worked with over 75 writers in one-on-one, hour-long sessions using research-based methods to help them move to the next stage in their writing process. I am not an authority but an attentive and curious reader. I am amazed by the incredible work of my peers and am thrilled to be a small part of bringing their ideas to life. Finding [the right words](digital-garden/philosophy/Jugaad%20and%20the%20Power%20of%20the%20Right%20Word.md) to express yourself is both empowering and world-shaping. Being a part of this incredible community of writers and teachers is one of the highlights of my undergraduate experience (shout out to the best bosses: [Sue Mendelsohn](https://english.columbia.edu/content/sue-mendelsohn) & [Jason Ueda](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/uwp/writing-center/consultants#JasonU), and to my incredible friend, who introduced me to this world, [Isabelle Pride](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabellepride/)).

After graduating in May 2023 I worked as a summer intern on the DevOps team at [37signals](https://37signals.com/), the makers of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and [Hey](https://www.hey.com/).   I've learned so much from the incredibly smart and kind people who mentored me in my first step out of college. I wrote a blog post [leaning imperative](https://dev.37signals.com/) on their dev blog, where I answered a question I asked Eron, my manager and Director of Ops, during our interview. 

I want to build technology with incredible people who value learning, community, and clear writing, and who are creating technology that empowers its users' ability to shape the world. I am generally not interested in fintech(blockchain), AI for the sake of using AI, selling ads, infringing user privacy, and military. 

While I enjoyed the challenge Ops at the tail end of their exciting and public migration off the cloud, the unique design culture at the company spoke to me. I want to the empathy I've developed as a writer to design technology. So for my next role, I want a more user-facing position. I am looking for opportunities starting in January of 2024. 
## üöÄ life
So much of this garden reflects how I live. I enjoy dancing and working out(doors). I need to exercise, read, and write every day. Here are some [rules](digital-garden/personal/My%20Rules%20for%20Sanity%20&%20Happiness.md) I try to live by and [Tools](digital-garden/personal/Tools.md) that I use. I am an essentialist trying to get rid of all the stuff that distracts me from what matters. I strive to open myself to being moved by people, experiences, and art. I love to [travel](digital-garden/travel%20and%20life%20journal/Travel.md) light, cheap, and with a friend (or make em on the way!). I've played [squash competitively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ3n9XHfAy8&t=1575s) and [climbed a mountain](https://adventure-pulse.com/mountaineering/kang-yatse-2)in Leh, India. Parts of me are always there, with my family and closest friends.
