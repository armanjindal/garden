*Ongoing reflections of a first time dancer on an introductory course in Modern dance,* 

One of the best parts about being an undergraduate is the introductory classes in fields. You are taught by masters of the craft. This has no relation to their ability to teach, but there are the few, who are both. They are golden. A few I've been privelleged to be taught have changed my life.

These unicorns (yes - they exist) do not make you deeply competent by the end of their course. Rather they initiate you into a world. You learn the language, methods and community. You learn what constitues "truth" and "beauty".  You observe *how* they do things, rather than *what* they do. 

The best teachers are often those who came to it late, because they can remeber what it is like for the unitiated. Those who can place the world  extends beyond the myopic focus needed for mastry. Caitlon Trainor's Modern Dance I, in a truly incredile semester, has stood out as one of the most important classes I will take in college. 

Caitlon takes it on herself to make us better people through dance. Her lessons though conveyed through language and concepts transcend them. Easeful body language, graceful movement, comfort in one's own skin,  failing (forward) with verve. It is a new epistemology. One of embodied knowledge. Of choreography,  movement, muscle activation and relaxation, all integrated with musicality. A phrase Caitlin uses, that I will shamless steal, is "brain-body". 
Dance transcends the duality of mind-body, and Caitlin is showing us how, as complete beginners. 

In order to capture and develop the lessons and observations from this incredible teacher and environment, I am going to write after every dance session. To journal on my thoughts, connections and ideas, and then present an edited and organized account of the ideas that have stuck with me 

Gaze - where you look is where you go. We have a deep human desire to look where others look. 

Modern dance is an interesting dance form. There is a tension between movement for one own sake, and then for perfomance. Its a tension we see manifest
