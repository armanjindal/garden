- Building a social map that shows the "life" in NY‚Äî¬†gigs, street artists' performances, farmers' markers ‚Äî near you in time and space! Think Google Maps "cafes near me" meets RA and that community event board built in the 90s. Shoot me an email if you'd like to be an early tester. 
- Returning to the working world and NYC after a wonderful, mind and soul-expanding four months of travel and time at home caring for my grandparents. 
- Talking to people and exploring opportunities to build things that create real value with incredible people who are learners and teachers. 

Updated September, 8th 2023:

-  Starting a four-month (post-graduation) sabbatical (September ‚Äî January) where I will be traveling. Starting in the Netherlands and ending in India. I'll be writing a travel "museletter" [here](https://world.hey.com/arman.jindal) ‚Äî subscribe to follow along. 
- Creating a "mapplication" üó∫Ô∏è to show events/real-time data "near me." As a backpacker in new places. I am asking people for recommendations. The best are "events." building on top of it to discover people, places, and events on the move. 
- I write here every day. 
- No YouTube. The site has introduced TikTok-like shorts, and they are addictive. My compromise is to download anything I want to watch on 4kVideoDownloader, to prevent the mindless scroll.
