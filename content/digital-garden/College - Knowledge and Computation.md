>Under development. An ongoing note on college, extracting value from an institution that seeks to exploit you, finding what college is actually good for, and the feeling of agency by shaping your course of study within constraints.

This course of study has emerged as I've followed interests and professors that ignited something in me, tempered by pragmatism and the constraints of being a person. 

It was first proposed in my junior year where I combined my interest in language, formal semantics and Natural Language processing, but has changed every semester as my interest shifted and I responded to the quality of professors teaching the class. 

One piece of advice I give anyone entering college is to get clear on what's really valuable about the expereince. Colleges, especially the elite ones, have a narrative about what they are for. Its mostly bullshit and doesn't foreground your interests.  Rather in the overly quantified period of time we live in, push toward quick metrics such as starting salaries, and graduation rates. There's a reason (elite) colleges don't do a happiness index on their graduating students. 

I am shamelessly ruthless when it comes to professors. If I get a bad vibe, or poor pedagogy, I'm out. College is too short to suffer though bad professors, and it is a unique opportunity to find mentors and masters to inititate you into a field. 

Learning how to program and build tech is best learnt on the job, not in a class. Reading timeless texts, talking and writing about them with people is invaluable So is being introduced to disciplines by masters of the craft. College for me has been about learning how to read, write, think and orient myself in a world of overwhelming possibility and false authority. It has been about building a community of friends, interlocultors, and developing a sense of what to ignore and avoid because of finitiude of fucks (enemies, toxicity, )


A series of courses that have combined Philosophy-Computer Science and History in order to answer the question:
- How do we transmit and represent knowledge to digital systems?
- Who gets to and why?

Below are the courses I've taken with special mention to how they have and continue to shape me. I feel immensly lucky to have taken several classes and been mentored by professors in ways in ways that changed the way I am in the world. I owe these teachers, who often feel as though they are working against the interest of the university, an infinite and irrepayable debt of gratitude.

Title: [Information—Computing—Infrastructure](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/#/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8479-20223-001)
- Graduate Seminar (History GR8479)
- Professor Matthew Jones - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nescioquid)
- Description: The course introduces the major works in the history of computing and information technologies, with particular attention to transformative methodologically important texts. Students will be likewise introduced to major current works in the history of technology and media studies. The course along the way provides an outline of the development of computing from the late nineteenth century.

 Take-aways:
 
 **The techno solutionism/utopinainsm of Silicon Valley** has a wierd presentism. They resist being located in history. There is a vested interest in By perpetuating the false idea of novelty ("like never before") allows for the rehashing of narratives and projects that throghout history have failed.
