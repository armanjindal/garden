>An ongoing note on college, extracting value from an institution whose interests don't always align with yours. Finding what college is actually good for, and the feeling of agency by shaping your course of study within constraints. 

I am graduating in a month. I cannot help but look back over the last few years with an overwhelming sense of gratitude and with the creeping, perhaps self-aggrandizing, feeling that I did college bloody well. This isn't an "advice" page on how you can do the same. 

This is a reminder page, of the many answers that I have come up with to the question of "Why am I here?"

The biggest mistake one can make when answering that question is to let someone else answer it or not answer it. The choice is irrelevant here. The narrative isn't. Here are some of the key realizations I have had during my time in college: 

- Learning under what conditions and which questions, you can trust only **your** experience. We are surrounded by false idols and idealogy. It's tempting to outsource many of the most important questions and aspects of the human condition . Trust yourself but know when, and when not to. 
- People — finding them, connecting with them, growing because of it, uplifting others, and allowing others to do the same. 
- Writing and Speaking: The skills of literacy and orality are easy to take for granted. Learning to engage, seriously, with the ideas, texts and therefore, narrative that has shaped is fucking powerful. It's key to shaping your own. 
- Recognizing the dignity and honor in making yourself teachable. There is a pernicious discourse that speaks of college students as juveniles. This is infantilizing, and self-fulfilling and doesn't speak to the people who are excellent at what they are doing. 
- Limits of the life of the mind  — you get first-row seats to see the paralyzed, pale, self-hating academic. You always hopefully are exposed to the ones who carry themselves with purpose and power. Who have found in their work or outside of it, sources of meaning that keep them grounded and connected to the world. The academy is a wonderful place, and its mere existence is a testament to the success of society, nothing is more insufferable than academics who forget that. 



Moves - Creating (and constantly tweaking) a joint Philosophy-Computer Science Major:

This course of study has emerged as I've followed interests and professors that ignited something in me. 

It was first proposed in my junior year where I combined my interest in language, formal semantics and Natural Language processing, but has changed every semester as my interest shifted and I responded to the quality of professors teaching the class. 

One piece of advice I give anyone entering college is to get clear on what's really valuable about the expereince. Colleges have a narrative about what they are for. Its mostly bullshit and doesn't foreground your interests.  Rather in the overly quantified period of time we live in, push toward quick metrics such as starting salaries, and graduation rates. There's a reason (elite) colleges don't do a happiness index on their graduating students. 

- Professor Nathaneal Shelley: 

- I am shamelessly ruthless when it comes to professors. If I get a bad vibe, or poor pedagogy, I'm out. College is too short to suffer though bad professors, and it is a unique opportunity to find mentors and masters to inititate you into a field.

- Learn from a place, what it can best teach you:
Learning how to program and build tech is best learnt on the job, not in a class. Reading timeless texts, and talking and writing about other people is invaluable. So is being introduced to disciplines by masters of the craft. 

College has been about learning how to read, write, think and orient myself in a world of overwhelming possibility and false authority.  developing a sense of what to ignore not because it is bad, but because of the finitude of attention
It has been about building a community of friends, and interlocultors.  . It has been about developing an Ethic of Attention — what is worth paying attention to. 


A series of courses that have combined Philosophy-Computer Science and History in order to answer the question:
- How do we transmit and represent knowledge to digital systems?
- Who gets to and why?

Below are the courses I've taken with special mention to how they have and continue to shape me. I feel immensly lucky to have taken several classes and been mentored by professors in ways in ways that changed the way I am in the world. I owe these teachers, who often feel as though they are working against the interest of the university, an infinite and irreparable debt of gratitude.

## **Influential Courses:**

I found these courses by talking to friends, compulsivley searching for courses and reading reviews, and the relentless vibe check.

Title: [Information—Computing—Infrastructure](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/#/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/HIST/GR8479-20223-001)
- Graduate Seminar (History GR8479)
- Professor Matthew Jones - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nescioquid)
- Description: The course introduces the major works in the history of computing and information technologies, with particular attention to transformative methodologically important texts. Students will be likewise introduced to major current works in the history of technology and media studies. The course along the way provides an outline of the development of computing from the late nineteenth century.

 Take-aways:
 
 **The techno solutionism/utopinainsm of Silicon Valley** has a wierd presentism. They resist being located in history. Which is a paradox. I think the development
 
Yet in perpetuating the false idea of novelty ("like never before") allows for the rehashing of narratives and projects that throughout history have failed. It is a local optimization that helps individual
