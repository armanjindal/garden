title: "Living Book Commentaries"

We've all been told and, in turn, tell ourselves to "read more." I'm skeptical. 

We've all met people who have (claimed to) read everything. They've got long Goodreads lists to back it up. I'm a little jealous. But like most of my "inadequacies," I've found that I am grateful that I am not one of these people.  While I've been tempted to create a list of what I've read 

When reading becomes **too** instrumental, books become checkboxes. Reading becomes stultifying. Authors' names become black box elusive figures of "authority" and, most perniciously, intellectual crutches. 

Books are magical. You can communicate with the past and glimpse a life and inner world that was lived. I read because it makes me more alive and connects me to the world differently. 

The author's intention does not bind books. To some, this is the first step into crass interpretive relativism. Instead, I see this as liberating. Books, like "history," are tools we can use marshall to create life and society â€” not trophies on a wall. There are a few books that are alive with me. I've found myself coming back to, rethinking, and re-reading. I want to capture that process here.

## Reading 
If you are comfortable reading something once, you've read for "information." Reading for "understanding" is reading up. These are the books that you didn't get on the first go. Books that made you question your ability to comprehend words on a page.
