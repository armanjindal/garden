title: "Living Book Commentaries"

We've all been told and, in turn, tell ourselves to "read more." I'm skeptical. 

We also know people who have (claimed to) read everything. They've got long Goodreads lists to back it up. I'm a little jealous. But like most of my "inadequacies," I've found that I am grateful that I am not one of these people.  While I've been tempted to create a list of what I've read 

When reading becomes **too** instrumental, books become checkboxes. Reading becomes stultifying. Authors' names become black box elusive figures of "authority" and, most perniciously, intellectual crutches. 

Books are magical. You can communicate with the past and glimpse a life and inner world that was lived. I read because it makes me more alive and connects me to the world differently. 

The author's intention does not bind books. To some, this is the first step into crass interpretive relativism. Instead, I see this as liberating. Books, like "history," are tools we can use to create life and society — not trophies on a wall. They are at once mirror of the self and contain the mysteries of the other — past and future. 

There are a few books and authors that speak to something  living in me. I've found myself coming back to, rethinking, and re-reading. I want to capture that process here.

## Reading Wisdom

- Read in the morning. Preferably before you look at a screen or a phone. 

- If you are comfortable reading something once, you've read for "information." Reading for "understanding" is reading up. These are the books that you didn't get on the first go. Books that made you question your ability to comprehend words on a page. These books are, in the words of Mortimer J Adler, books you read for "understanding."

- Treat your to-read list [like a river, not a bucker](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/river). We don't expect to capture everything in a flowing river, just a things we may pick up (and put back) as it flows in its merry way. A bucket demands that we empty it before filling it up again. I am guilty of doing this. Gain of salt: I love to buy books and many that I've not read. This may just be my rationalization from my consumerist bibliophilic tendencies. I still think its true, even in the digital world.
