Translation: Barbara Stoler-Miller

Bhagavad-Gita - Chapter 2, pg 42

As the mountainous depths
of the ocean
are unmoved when waters 
rush into it, 
so the man unmoved 
when desires enter him
attains a peace that eludes
the man **of** many desires 

When he renounces all desires
and **acts** without craving, 
possessiveness
or **individuality**, he finds peace.

Q: What does it mean to act without individuality?
