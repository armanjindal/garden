The Second Teaching: Philosophy and Spiritual Discipline

Page 37, Verse 39-40
> No effort in this world 
> is lost or wasted;
> a fragment of sacred duty 
> saves you from great
> 
> This understanding is unique
> in its innercore of resolve; 
> \[  ... \] 
> diffuse and pointless are the ways 
> irresolute men understand

Page 42, Verse 70-72

> As the mountainous depths
> of the ocean
> are unmoved when waters 
> rush into it, 
> so the man unmoved
> when desires enter him
> attains a peace that eludes
> the man **of** many desires 

> When he renounces all desires
> and **acts** without craving, 
> possessiveness
> or **individuality**, he finds peace.

Q: What does it mean to act without individuality?


The Fourth Teaching â€” Knowledge (BM)
Page: 53-54

> "I desire no fruit of actions,
 and actions do not defile me;
one who knows this about me
is not bound by action
\[...]
What is action? What is inaction?
\[...]

> A man who sees inaction in action 
and action in inaction
has understanding among men, 
disciplined 

> The wise say a man is learned 
when his plans lack constructs of desire, 
when his actions are burned 
by the fire of knowledge.

> Abandoning attachment to fruits of action, 
> always content, independent, 
> he does nothing at all 
> even when he engages in action

> He incurs no guilt if he has no hope, 
> restrains his thought and himself, 
> abandons possession 
> and performs actions with his body alone


Q: Discerning "action" from "inaction" is not trivial. "Acting" does not equaling "doing."

Q: Knowledge as "purifier"? 

What is the ontological status of knowledge? What does it mean to be knowledge? In a Western context knowledge always is understood as additive. This idea is embedded into the language. We "gain" and "posses" knowledge as if it were a material quantity stored in our brain, like books on a shelf. Memory is a look up operation on this table. 

Though I do yet posses the language, this seems to refer to knowledge as purifying/subtractive quality. Much like  philosophical role of critique: it is the clearing of false/unhealthy belief.

Q: What is the relationship between knowledge and action? On one end, knowledge arises from action, but also directs it.


> Content with whatever comes by chance, 
> beyond dualities, free from envy, 
> impartial to failure and success, 
> he is not bound even when he acts.
