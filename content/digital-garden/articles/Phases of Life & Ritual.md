Carving up the world, which is to say, choosing the words, concepts and categories the we use understand and explain ourselves is essential. I just graduated from college which in, America, is one of a few secular rites of passage. After this "phase" — not yet an "adult" — was time to declare independence, find a job, move, go to an office and set up a life. However, in my post college "phase" instead of finding a full time job, I applied to and got an internship at 37signals (makers of Basecamp) over the summer instead. Instead of working in an office I worked remotely. Now "post-grad-summer-internship" I am finding myself  

You might think this need to periodize is excessive, a neurotic function of my over socialized brain. Which is fair. However, I argue that we periodize life weather we are conscious of it or not. Even if we resist it, it is done for us whether we like it or not. Fully recognizing and intentionally periodizing helps us immensely. Because:

1. Help us to find clarify and **focus**, by intentionally putting off responsibilities that are delegated to another phase. 
2. Specificity – a piece of advice may be "correct" but not specific. Everyone is so concerned with saying things that are "generally" true. 
This is by way of grand moral theories — heuristics such as Kant's or Utilitarianism "maximally benefits the most people." The et  hics of a warrior on battle field are different than that of a student in college, or a doctor in medicine. The Good/True/Beautiful are more specific. Should a freshman get drunk and go to a frat party ? Yes. Should a 45 year old divorcee. Probably not. The world is filled with children trying to be adults and adults trying to be children. 
3. 
Rituals, small and large, help us to demarcate, (re)costruct,

Religion often helps with this. Births, marriages, and deaths are where turn to religion and the rituals they have to gather our community. The Hindu philosophy of *Āśrama* (stages) outlines four stages each ~25 years long: _[Brahmacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmacharya "Brahmacharya")_ (Student's life), _[Grihastha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grihastha "Grihastha")_ (household life), _[Vanaprastha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanaprastha "Vanaprastha")_ (retired life), _[Sannyasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannyasa "Sannyasa")_ (renounced life). Your "Dharma" changes with each phase, with it your priotires, moral standard of "good" and "bad" 

"micro periods", on the scale of 3-4 months, which in more macro scale feel small. 

Age is one. Projects another. Relationships or in my case periods of travel between jobs. 

However, there are some 








I remeber periods most intentionally by writing. It is an affirmation of this kind of "second order" agency,

In conversation with a close friend, he mentioned to me that I am not in a rush.  

One of the greatest benefits of is helping not rush and focus
