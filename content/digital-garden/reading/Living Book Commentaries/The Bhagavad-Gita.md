The Habit of Decisiveness — Reading Discourse Six

It is hard to commit. It always has, but now in the age of information without meaning, in an age where we carry possibility in our pockets staying a course is harder than ever. Why?  It takes time. It cannot be rushed. Emotions are fickle. One day you feel a wind at your back, charging forward. You were made for this, you think. The next a crushing weight on your chest. It could be from the most incidental reactions. You think you need to change. You cannot focus. By you I mean me. 

> The practitioner of yoga
> who is content 
> with discernment and wisdom 
> **unmoving**, with sense conquered
> to whom a lump of clay, 
> a stone and a piece of gold
> are the same, 
> is said to be joined to *yoga*
> — LP(6.8)

Here the "discernment and wisdom" are about what matters.  In order to be unmoved by the winds of desire and of emotions we have to see that clay, stone, gold (outcomes) are the same. One does do *yoga* but is joined to it. Yoga comes from the Sanskrit "to yoke". To be joined to yoga is to be pulled by it. Later describing meditation: 

> when one directs the mind
> to a single point
> actions of the senses 
> and thoughts controlled, 
> sitting oneself onto the seat,
> one should join to yoga
> in order to purify
> the self
> — LP (6.12)

In the Gita meditation and action in the world can be the same. Meditation as a practice is training. The wisdom here is in the first two lines. The mind needs an anchor. A point of focus. A drifting mind, idle is at the mercy of its conditioning. 

> Yoga is not about 
> eating too much, 
> nor is it about 
> not easting at all. 
> It is not about the practice 
> of sleeping too much
> not is it about 
> keeping awake. 

Yoga is not self-discipline or self-punishment. 

> For one who is
> joined to yoga
> yoga destroys all pain -
> in food and sport, 
> in the undertaking 
> of action, 
> and in sleeping
> and awakening.

What does it mean to be joined?

> One is said 
> to be joined in this way, 
> when one's thought
> is restrained;
 .... 
 > beyond longing 
 > and all desire
 
 
> One is like a lit lamp 
> that does not flicker, 
> standing without wind
— LP (6.16-19)

To not flicker. I love the definition of commitment, because to flicker in the winds of emotion prevents you from commitment. It is the product of a mind not focused, of a self not joined to yoga.


Key words to look at in Sanskrit: 
- "unmoving" — Is it similar to flicker? 
-  Longing and desire — how are they different? 




Philosophy and Spiritual Discipline

The Fourth Discourse (LP): Verse 19-20

> Insightful ones 
> call that one a pandit 
> who has **winnowed**
> all aims and desire 
> from all endeavors 
> and whose action is burned 
> in the fire 
> of wisdom

To winnow is an interesting verb that suggests the removal of aim and desire from action (willful action) is a gradual process that one can begin now. I've always enjoyed the imagery of wisdom as a "purifier" (see below) and something that's subtractive. Unlike the accumulation of information or knowledge, wisdom is winnowing. It's a focus of attention by disregarding the infinity of the other stuff that doesn't matter. Wisdom is a "knife" that severs the "doubt" from your heart. Doubt of what? Perhaps that wisdom lies outside of the self (atman). 

> When one has let go 
> of clinging 
> to the fruits of action, 
> always content
> and independent 
> even when turning 
> toward action, 
> that one **does** nothing at all

Doing and acting. The phrase "turning toward action" suggests that it is an orientation (of life) rather than a moment. Doing, on the other hand, is more of a moment of willful. It's filled with self-awareness about the thing performed. Perhaps one "acts" here without the intentionality of doing but of duty. 


BM: 

Page 37, Verse 39-40
> No effort in this world 
> is lost or wasted;
> a fragment of sacred duty 
> saves you from great
> 
> This understanding is unique
> in its innercore of resolve; 
> \[  ... \] 
> diffuse and pointless are the ways 
> irresolute men understand

Page 42, Verse 70-72

> As the mountainous depths
> of the ocean
> are unmoved when waters 
> rush into it, 
> so the man unmoved
> when desires enter him
> attains a peace that eludes
> the man **of** many desires 

> When he renounces all desires
> and **acts** without craving, 
> possessiveness
> or **individuality**, he finds peace.

Q: What does it mean to act without individuality?


The Fourth Teaching — Knowledge (BM)
Page: 53-54

> "I desire no fruit of actions,
 and actions do not defile me;
one who knows this about me
is not bound by action
\[...]
What is action? What is inaction?
\[...]

> A man who sees inaction in action 
and action in inaction
has understanding among men, 
disciplined 

> The wise say a man is learned 
when his plans lack constructs of desire, 
when his actions are burned 
by the fire of knowledge.

> Abandoning attachment to fruits of action, 
> always content, independent, 
> he does nothing at all 
> even when he engages in action

> He incurs no guilt if he has no hope, 
> restrains his thought and himself, 
> abandons possession 
> and performs actions with his body alone

- Discerning "action" from "inaction" is not trivial. "Acting" does not equal "doing."

Q: Knowledge as "purifier"? 

What is the ontological status of knowledge? What does it mean to be knowledgeable? In a Western context, knowledge is always understood as additive. This idea is embedded into the language. We "gain" and "possess" knowledge as if it were a material quantity stored in our brain, like books on a shelf. Memory is a look-up operation on this table. 

However, here, knowledge has a purifying/subtractive quality. Much like the philosophical role of critique, it is the clearing of false/unhealthy beliefs. 

In the introductory section, Laurie Patton's section on the *gunas*, the three qualities of the universe *sattva*.  The term isn't just truth but its 'quality.' The quality is one of lightness. This is an interesting contrast where I've heard truth often described as a burdensome weight — something that is crushing. 

Q: What is the relationship between knowledge and action? On one end, knowledge arises from action but also directs it.

> Content with whatever comes by chance, 
> beyond dualities, free from envy, 
> impartial to failure and success, 
> he is not bound even when he acts.




Thanks for a great conversation, Aditya! I'm still slightly amused that you remember your IB score (and irked you beat me by a point, haha), but IB does that. I've made enemies on flights over my defense of TOK.  I also just read that you, too, enjoy techno. De Witte's recent track, Pria is disturbingly good. Cheers, Arman
