Philosophy and Spiritual Discipline

The Fourth Discourse (LP): Verse 19-20

> Insightful ones 
> call that one a pandit 
> who has **winnowed**
> all aims and desire 
> from all endeavors 
> and whose action is burned 
> in the fire 
> of wisdom

To winnow is an interesting verb that suggests the removal of aim and desire from action (willful action) is a gradual process that one can begin now. I've always enjoyed the imagery of wisdom as a "purifier" (see below) and something that's subtractive. Unlike the accumulation of information or knowledge, wisdom is winnowing. It's a focus of attention by disregarding the infinity of the other stuff that doesn't matter. Wisdom is a "knife" that severs the "doubt" from your heart. Doubt of what? Perhaps that wisdom lies outside of the self (atman). 

> When one has let go 
> of clinging 
> to the fruits of action, 
> always content
> and independent 
> even when turning 
> toward action, 
> that one **does** nothing at all

Doing and acting. The phrase "turning toward action" suggests that it is an orientation (of life) rather than a moment. Doing, on the other hand, is more of a moment of willful. It's filled with self-awareness about the thing performed. Perhaps one "acts" here without the intentionality of doing but of duty. 


BM: 

Page 37, Verse 39-40
> No effort in this world 
> is lost or wasted;
> a fragment of sacred duty 
> saves you from great
> 
> This understanding is unique
> in its innercore of resolve; 
> \[  ... \] 
> diffuse and pointless are the ways 
> irresolute men understand

Page 42, Verse 70-72

> As the mountainous depths
> of the ocean
> are unmoved when waters 
> rush into it, 
> so the man unmoved
> when desires enter him
> attains a peace that eludes
> the man **of** many desires 

> When he renounces all desires
> and **acts** without craving, 
> possessiveness
> or **individuality**, he finds peace.

Q: What does it mean to act without individuality?


The Fourth Teaching — Knowledge (BM)
Page: 53-54

> "I desire no fruit of actions,
 and actions do not defile me;
one who knows this about me
is not bound by action
\[...]
What is action? What is inaction?
\[...]

> A man who sees inaction in action 
and action in inaction
has understanding among men, 
disciplined 

> The wise say a man is learned 
when his plans lack constructs of desire, 
when his actions are burned 
by the fire of knowledge.

> Abandoning attachment to fruits of action, 
> always content, independent, 
> he does nothing at all 
> even when he engages in action

> He incurs no guilt if he has no hope, 
> restrains his thought and himself, 
> abandons possession 
> and performs actions with his body alone

- Discerning "action" from "inaction" is not trivial. "Acting" does not equal "doing."

Q: Knowledge as "purifier"? 

What is the ontological status of knowledge? What does it mean to be knowledgeable? In a Western context, knowledge is always understood as additive. This idea is embedded into the language. We "gain" and "possess" knowledge as if it were a material quantity stored in our brain, like books on a shelf. Memory is a look-up operation on this table. 

However, here, knowledge has a purifying/subtractive quality. Much like the philosophical role of critique, it is the clearing of false/unhealthy beliefs. 

In the introductory section, Laurie Patton's section on the *gunas*, the three qualities of the universe *sattva*.  The term isn't just truth but its 'quality.' The quality is one of lightness. This is an interesting contrast where I've heard truth often described as a burdensome weight — something that is crushing. 

Q: What is the relationship between knowledge and action? On one end, knowledge arises from action but also directs it.

> Content with whatever comes by chance, 
> beyond dualities, free from envy, 
> impartial to failure and success, 
> he is not bound even when he acts.
