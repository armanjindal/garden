The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen

Last Update: February 28th, 2024
### The Right Questions

- We have a deep need to self-present. 
- As a self reflection:
	- What are your ultimate goals? What do you want to offer the world?
	- What are you doing when you feel most alive? 
	- How exactly do you fill your days? 
- Hiring traits:
	- Extreme talent that is specific
	- Spirit of generosity, by using a 'take me back' technique. Allow them to be in a narrative.
- Questioners: people who are comfortable asking questions. As kids we are always asking question but we become insecure and self protective. 
- Asking a question is weirdly vulnerable — you admit you don't know — and the goods ones are a **surrender of power.** 
- Questioning as a "moral practice"
	- Adpting a posture of humility
	- Admitting that you don't know what is going on in the other mind
	- Perspective Receiving vs Perspective Taking
- Questions:
	- Sometimes simple questions are best (asked about life story followed by 'and then what happened')
	- Broad dumb question can be better than an specific smart one (especially if it is about posturing)
- Worst questions:
	- Evaluate
	- Closed (limits the frame of the question). Give the answerer the freedom answer as deeply or shallow at they like.
	- Vague 
- Best:
	- Open ended 
	- Inviting the other person to take the conversation where they want to go
	- "How did you/ what's it like/ tell me about/ in what ways" 
	- "Tell me about the last time you went to a store after 7pm"
- Illuminators:
	- Ask Qs that probe for commonalities
		- Where did you grow up? 
		- Lovely name - how did your parents choose it
	- Ask Big question:
		- What crossroads are you at? 
		- What would you do if you weren't afraid? 
		- If we meet a year from now, what will be celebrating. 
		- If the next five years are a chapter - what is it about? 
	- 
	- What is the NO you keep postponing. What is the YES you no longer give
