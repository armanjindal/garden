Introduction: Power-User

> A power user is a user of computers, software and other electronic devices, who uses advanced features of computer hardware,[1][2][3] operating systems,[4] programs, or websites[5] which are not used by the average user. A power user might not have extensive technical knowledge of the systems they use[6] but is rather characterized by competence or desire to make the most intensive use of computer programs or systems.
> - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user)

*Power users* characterize a particular kind of user of technology.  We all know them. You may even be one. Power users are the ones who have mastered keyboard shortcuts, often customizing or creating keybindings. Power users know what they want from their tool and take the trouble to mold it to fit their use.  While the use of the term decline has declined since it peaked in 1990[^1], I argue that the number and importance of power users are only rising.  

There is an increasing amount of consumer software for a semi-technical audience geared toward power users. Low / no-code tools are becoming more popular. Given that we live in an age with inescapable and seemingly increasing digital mediation, our relationship to the technology we use and those who produce it matter. 

These technologies shape how we interact with the world, form identity, and understand ourselves. Living in what Nick Seaver calls an Age of Bewilderment, our subjectivities today are characterized by overwhelm. Software, particularly recommendation algorithms, purportedly helps us overcome this by encouraging a passive use of technology and instilling a defeatist response to complexity.  Power users and power-user native software are subversive models of collaboration. 

Goals & Methodology:
In this independent study, in Section I I develop and fully define the concept of "power-user" by situating them historically and pulling out similarities and different between three other user groups. 

1. The freesoftware/open source "geeks" Christopher Kelty discusses in his book *Two Bits - The Cultural Significance of Free Software* published 
2. The hackers,
3. Content creators and passive user of Web 2.0 social media sites Finn Brunton describes in his 2014 *SPAM - A Shodow History of the Internet*

I do this putting in conversation the works of Christopher Kelty on freesoftware/open source "geeks" that characrize "Web 1.0" Christopher Kelty describes with his concept of the "recurisive public" in *Two Bits*, the less technical, passive consumer of Web 2.0 who Tim Brunton describes as a "reactive public", and then hacker and their politics disucssed primarily in the work Gabriella Coleman. 


Each distinct kind of use is grounded in a moral framework ,  forms community and posses different degrees of awarness of their use and community. Drawing on existing analysis of other user groups, I will distinguish power users from hacker, content creators, 



Broadly under the banner of STS — science and technology studies or science, technology, society depending on who you ask — I seek to undesta

Power usersas distinct users from "geeks" of the early internet, hackers, and consumer of social media of "Web 2.0." 

This historical lense is informed by Matthew Allen claim that a better way to do history of the internet, is discourse of *use* rather than *version*. While this is focused on use it is not focused exclusivley on users. One of the most distinct and interesting aspects of power users is their explicit encouragment and ongoing negotiation with the producers of the technoloy. The focus of the next section, which helps to ground the concepts and analysis in this section, is fo conceptual apparatus developed and introduced in this section will be used in later sections a case study on an illustrative example of "power-user native" called Obsidian. 





- By contrasting and comparing the particular *use* and *user* that we call the Power-user,

Obsidian - Case Study
- To ground this study and make concrete claims about technology I will conduct 




-  The software is part of them, an extension of their capacity to shape the world. They epitomize a distinct relationship with technology I will describe, analyze and historicize in this independent study.



- I am also seeking to understand the implications of this distinct kind of use. The majority of work in this prospectus will focus on the definition of the concept and make an argument for its conceptual use to better understand the descriptive and normative implications of this unique and politically compelling relationship with technology. 

-   Power-users have a distinct relationship with the softwares they use, and to individuals who produced it.






Power User Vs. Recursive Public Free Software
-   Free software was in Kelty’s terms a significant “reorientation in the relationship of knowledge and power” on the basis of a particular “moral and technological order.’ 
-   I locate this power as an agency to shape their technology enabled by producers who have opened the software to be modified at a “useful level of abstraction.” This unique relationship between user and producer is marked by a reflexive awareness of the existence and limits of power-users shaping capacity.
- Overcome the problems with the recursive public. 
	- Infrastructure is that which enables you to build other things. Infrastructure creates the conditions of possibility. 

    
-   Power-users preserve some aspects of this re-orientation, albeit with a different moral and political order. 
    
-   Specifically, it is power to shape technology, participate in a community of technical peers, make arguments with running code, but unlike “geeks” are not 

Power User Vs. Hacker: 
	- Hackers have an antogonistic relation with the software they are hacking. 
	- They will present an 
-   Power-users have the means to modify the tool for their specific use and distribute it to the community, often as a “plug-in” . In this case, unlike a “hacker”, the power to modify is not adversarial. It is not wrestled from producers of software but granted to them by the producers of the software, who recognize they cannot predict nor should they, all the ways in which the tool they are building might be used.

2. As creating a different kind of users. 

- A structured response to complexity as opposed to a bewildered one. 
    
-   This more active user producer relation with technology whereby users can modify to do things producers could not anticipate, and recognizes, gives this group a unique self-awareness of the limits of that modifiability.-This power is unique to a distinct group of users who understand themselves as able to shape what they use. As such, they are aware of the limits of their technology and the ways in which it shapes identity - by constraining self-expression. 
    
-   This awareness distinguishes them from other user groups. 
    
-   They provide a fascinating window into the ways in which design not only drives use, but also constructs its users. 
    
-   The rules of a platform, the degree to which users can shape it, and community of collaboration and knowledge transfer give rise to a a particular relation between the users of a software and the producer. This relationship bro and the  user concept of agency.
    
-   Furthermore, analyzing this distinct user group is useful to understand other kinds of users, such as content creators, and the general trend to encourage user-generated content across numerous platforms. 





Section I: Locating the Power User in History 

-   Big Idea: Situate the Power User and the community within conceptual framework, of Kelty & Brunton - Recursive Vs. Reactive Publics. 
    

-   The “rise” of power users might make it sound like this is a recent phenomenon. The earlier users of the Internet, who were also its “producers,” are power-users. 
    

-   In his Two Bits Kelty examines the “cultural significance of free software”. In he shows how a “moral and ethical framework” underlie free software as a reorientation in the relationship between knowledge and power enabled by the infrastructure of the internet 
    
-   I am also interested in tracing how and why this particular relationship between user and producer of technology emerged. 
    
-   Power users are similar to the “geeks” of the early Internet,
    

-   The failed utopian promise of open source … what can we recover from it? 
    
-   In order to do this, I will situate the power-user, their identity constituting relationship with their software, and the community they form into an existing form of scholarship that has sought to understand the publics that are formed by different user groups. Specifically, the technical “geeks” of the “early internet” that comprise Kelty’s recursive public and the relatively non-technical users who are most susceptible to Spam, Brunton labels are reactive publics. I will then focus on the invisible ways in which 
    

-   Claim:  
    


    
-   Brought to community through the use of a software. 
    
-   Power users and software designed for them however present lower technical barriers to entry. You get a lot out of the box, and power-users tend to work at a higher level of abstraction. 
    
-   User generated content. 
    
-   Overcome the incredibly high technical barriers to entry to contribute. Kelty was obsessed with lowest level of infrastructure and placed a lot of importance on the infrastructure as a form of argumentation - but isn’t discord good enough?
    
-   However, Power User can use running code (which doesn't even have to be code) as a form of argumentation at a level of abstraction above infrastructure, focused output.
    

  

Methodological Claim:  Use as a vehicle to analyze the internet vs Web 1.0/Web2.0. Although the use of the versioning can be helpful to tell a particular narrative.

-   Big Idea: Historical Narrative - Move from Web 1.0 (recursive) → Web 2.0 
    

-   Matthew Allen - What was Web 2.0? Versions as the dominant mode of internet history 
    
-   Move from a “geek” 
    
-   We should distinguish groups of users based on their use of the internet, and not on the basis of some a versioning of the Web that seeks to craft their own narrative.
    

  
  
  

Section II: Case Study: Obsidian - Case for Power Users and Power User Native Software

-   Through a case study of the popular note taking app Obsidian, I will also seek to understand both its users as well as producers, and the relationship between as an example of a community of power user and an example of a native power user software.
    
-   Open Standards for File Format:
	-   Markdown (Research this history)
- 
- 
- Higher Level of Abstraction than Open Source:
-   Ongoing Negotiation of power between Users and Producers. Software creators don’t claim to anticipate the possible uses, but also do not expose everything. 
    


    

-   APIs 
    
-   Data Access / “Local First”  
    

-   Decision as to why they are NOT open source. 
    

-   Distinguish between Notion 
    

  

Section II: Creating Subjects through User Design   

-    Creation of Passive Users: 
    

-   SPAM Reactive Publics and the Creation of the Bewildered Subject - Nick Seaver (Spotify Recommendations) 
    

-   There is an apparent producer of technology that is qualitatively different from the relationship other user groups, such as content-creator on Instagram or a Spotify music listener has to producers of these technology. 
    

  

Claim: A dangerous aspect of identity constitution through softwares designed for passive use, is that the influence is pernicious: 

-   Complicates simple democratic / decoloniality narratives of diverse content creators (Kavita)- different kind of users on TikTok. Unaware of how the platforms shapes identity. 
    
-   Wierd self-reflexive diminished agency: jokes about hacking / decoding the algorithm that recommended it. But also lacking the imagination/agency to go elsewhere.
    
-   Vested interest in telling people there is no other way (since otherwise there would be “too” much). 
    

  

Section II: Anticipate Counter Argument: The Comparison Doesn’t Hold - Facebook Instagram DNE Obsidian

Content Creation Software (i.e Instagram/Facebook) also expose developer APIs. Their major market are users who DON’T want 

-   Content Creators. Invisible constraints on identity expression and formation. 
    
-   Users have little agency to no agency. Create in the conditions of Bewildered subjectivity. Alienated from the infrastructure. Lack self-reflexive awareness.
    

  
  

Section III: Power User Designed Software Constitutes a Better Kind of User - Creative User! 

-   The producers of software that are designed for power-users organize complexity for them by way of well-documented and active forums, that encourage a piecemeal approach to complexity rather than a consumption driven by Bewilderment
    
-   Poweruser software encourages creation with awareness of the limits of the infrastructure of the software. A relationship with complexity that seeks to understand and marshall it for creation, not 
    
-   Web 2.0 software obfuscate the infrastructure and influence of the construction of the consumer Power user software encourages users to see the limits:
    

-   Claim: What if content platforms had different algorithms you could try. Whereby users could curate their own feeds. Open Source
    
-   Claim: Power User Software Creates Better Kinds of Publics (I’m not sure about this claim) 
    

  

Section III: Power Users and the Ethics of “Hacker” - The Moral and Social Implications of Creative Users.

-   Big Idea: Power user subjects considered in light of “hacker culture” and “hacker politics”
    

  

-   Hackers - You’d think individualistic BUT very community driven. Knowledge Transfer big. The “MENTOR” (Hackers manifesto)
    

-   Knowledge transfer - 
    

-   “Software deserves free speech protection” (1991 - Phil Zimmer 
    

-   Analogizing software to writing, as if we are doomed to only read. 
    

-   Creative Subjects have a different response to complexity. One that is about focused, and narrowly defined goals. Not Bewilderment!
    

-   In explaining the high degree of political pluralsm in hacker, and the poltical agnosticism that allows hackers with very different politics to work together, Coleman notes that the “political agnosticism” “follows from a drive to configure project goals narrowly, often around technical or civil liberties goals alone” (‘
    

-   Hacker Politics antithetical to “Silicon valley entrepreneurship style”
    

  
  
  
  
  

So What? Implication 

-   I’ve always wondered why Open Source was always most successful were at the level of infrastructure. I.e Docker, Kubernetes, the UNIX/Debian OS, and in the formation of internet protocols. Does the level of abstraction have something to do with it?
    
-   Power users work at the level of APIs and data, not underlying infrastructure. 
    

-   Understanding different user groups relation to technology, and the degree to which they understand themselves as able to shape it, matters because softwares we use in work, life and play have immense power to shape identity and the ways we form community.The degree to which users understand themselves as shaped by technology, feel they can shape it, and
