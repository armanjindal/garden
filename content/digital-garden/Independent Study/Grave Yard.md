Snippets of writing that I wanted to hold on to: 

- Power users do not necessarily need to be able to "code," although many might learn snippets if they need.  Some require more effective technical skills than others. The distinguishing feature of this kind of user and their use of the software is a feeling of comfort and agency to shape it for their needs. Power users are the ones who have mastered keyboard shortcuts. They know how to install or build plugins to extend functionality and stitch it into their workflow with other tools. 
- I am also seeking to understand the implications of this distinct kind of use. The majority of work in this prospectus will focus on the definition of the concept and make an argument for its conceptual use to better understand the descriptive and normative implications of this unique and politically compelling relationship with technology. 









    

-   In his Two Bits Kelty examines the “cultural significance of free software”. In he shows how a “moral and ethical framework” underlie free software as a reorientation in the relationship between knowledge and power enabled by the infrastructure of the internet 
    
-   I am also interested in tracing how and why this particular relationship between user and producer of technology emerged. 
    
-   Power users are similar to the “geeks” of the early Internet,
    

-   The failed utopian promise of open source … what can we recover from it? 

    

-   Claim:  
-   Brought to the community through the use of software. 
    

    
-   User generated content. 
    
-   Overcome the incredibly high technical barriers to entry to contribute. Kelty was obsessed with lowest level of infrastructure and placed a lot of importance on the infrastructure as a form of argumentation - but isn’t discord good enough?
    
-   However, Power User can use running code (which doesn't even have to be code) as a form of argumentation at a level of abstraction above infrastructure, focused output.
    
  
  
Section II: Creating Subjects through User Design 
-   SPAM Reactive Publics and the Creation of the Bewildered Subject - Nick Seaver (Spotify Recommendations) 
    

-   There is an apparent producer of technology that is qualitatively different from the relationship other user groups, such as content-creator on Instagram or a Spotify music listener has to producers of these technology. 
    

  

Claim: A dangerous aspect of identity constitution through softwares designed for passive use, is that the influence is pernicious: 

-   Complicates simple democratic / decoloniality narratives of diverse content creators (Kavita)- different kind of users on TikTok. Unaware of how the platforms shapes identity. 
    
-   Wierd self-reflexive diminished agency: jokes about hacking / decoding the algorithm that recommended it. But also lacking the imagination/agency to go elsewhere.
    
-   Vested interest in telling people there is no other way (since otherwise there would be “too” much). 
    

  

Section II: Anticipate Counter Argument: The Comparison Doesn’t Hold - Facebook Instagram DNE Obsidian

Content Creation Software (i.e Instagram/Facebook) also expose developer APIs. Their major market are users who DON’T want 

-   Content Creators. Invisible constraints on identity expression and formation. 
    
-   Users have little agency to no agency. Create in the conditions of Bewildered subjectivity. Alienated from the infrastructure. Lack self-reflexive awareness.
    

  
  

Section III: Power User Designed Software Constitutes a Better Kind of User - Creative User! 

-   The producers of software that are designed for power-users organize complexity for them by way of well-documented and active forums, that encourage a piecemeal approach to complexity rather than a consumption driven by Bewilderment
    
-   Poweruser software encourages creation with awareness of the limits of the infrastructure of the software. A relationship with complexity that seeks to understand and marshall it for creation, not 
    
-   Web 2.0 software obfuscate the infrastructure and influence of the construction of the consumer Power user software encourages users to see the limits:
    

-   Claim: What if content platforms had different algorithms you could try. Whereby users could curate their own feeds. Open Source
    
-   Claim: Power User Software Creates Better Kinds of Publics (I’m not sure about this claim) 
    

  

Section III: Power Users and the Ethics of “Hacker” - The Moral and Social Implications of Creative Users.

-   Big Idea: Power user subjects considered in light of “hacker culture” and “hacker politics”
    

  

-   Hackers - You’d think individualistic BUT very community driven. Knowledge Transfer big. The “MENTOR” (Hackers manifesto)
    

-   Knowledge transfer - 
    

-   “Software deserves free speech protection” (1991 - Phil Zimmer 
    

-   Analogizing software to writing, as if we are doomed to only read. 
    

-   Creative Subjects have a different response to complexity. One that is about focused, and narrowly defined goals. Not Bewilderment!
    

-   In explaining the high degree of political pluralsm in hacker, and the poltical agnosticism that allows hackers with very different politics to work together, Coleman notes that the “political agnosticism” “follows from a drive to configure project goals narrowly, often around technical or civil liberties goals alone” (‘
    

-   Hacker Politics antithetical to “Silicon valley entrepreneurship style”
    
  

So What? Implication 

-   I’ve always wondered why Open Source was always most successful were at the level of infrastructure. I.e Docker, Kubernetes, the UNIX/Debian OS, and in the formation of internet protocols. Does the level of abstraction have something to do with it?
    
-   Power users work at the level of APIs and data, not underlying infrastructure. 
    

-   Understanding different user groups relation to technology, and the degree to which they understand themselves as able to shape it, matters because softwares we use in work, life and play have immense power to shape identity and the ways we form community.The degree to which users understand themselves as shaped by technology, feel they can shape it, and
