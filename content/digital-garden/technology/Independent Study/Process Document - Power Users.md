A growing stack on the notes to self from feedback office hours and all the miscellaneous shit involved in an independent study/thesis, documented here. These notes are a structure to the degree to which they help me write the actual thing.

Note to Self - Be less impressed and more involved. Follow your curiosity here. You love this, and this is you. Make the task something you enjoy doing. Write, even if it is just a little every damn day.
