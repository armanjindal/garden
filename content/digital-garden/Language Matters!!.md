title: "Language Matters!!"

Because it does, and my dear friend [Isabelle Pride]() says so. 

Jokes. 

But it really does. In the most fundamental way. Language is at the core of how we construct our psychological reality. It is something we can change and be aware of. 

I don't have a coherent theory of cognition and there is plenty of crazy dense philosophical and psychological work in this area. My goal here is not to explain how it works, but that it is **important.** There are stakes to our language and not just political ones. 

Language impacts cognition. Certain words trigger categories of related and different ideas, images, and memories. Cognition is how we construct the world. Language then is one of the base constituents of reality.

So let's pay attention to what words and metaphors we use. They shape our world and are the "limits" of it.
