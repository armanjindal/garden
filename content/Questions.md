- What makes some a "*mystic*"?

Benjamin, Simone Weil, philosophers, thinkers, and writers I love who are often labeled as "mystics."? How? Can I become one? I'm so far from being mystical, though! Is it because the ideas they are expressing are **inexpressable** (which is to say require direct experience)? Why do you think we can "read" ourselves to Enlightenment? What a terribly stultifying life. Then we could just hook ourselves up to an IV drip. No. Life is lived. Wisdom is experienced, and a form of embodied knowledge. If this is the case, I want to ONLY mystics.
