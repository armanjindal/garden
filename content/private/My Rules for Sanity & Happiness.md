I've had a fraught relationship with rules. As with any list of rules, the last rule, straight from Orwell  

15. "Break any of these rules sooner than say \[or do!] anything outright barbarous."

Please interpret them as MY rules for MY life. Please interpret the 2nd person pronouns as  

> "I trust that none will _stretch the seams_ in putting on the _coat_, for it may do good service to him whom it fits."

1. Work out, breathe fresh air every day, and get into the sun. Lift, run, swim, climb mountains, fight, and stretch. Your body was meant to move. 

2. Care for and love your body. It is your only true home. "Spend not one more second doing anything but loving it." Be thankful for its proper function. The one thing you can be sure of is it will deteriorate, and in a moment, the functions you took for granted could disappear.

4. Plan your day. Not in a way you are bound by it, but as a day you want to have. Plan to the degree that you do not need to bring your phone. Plan even if you know it will change. Its a recognition of your limited time and energy within the 24 hours that make up the day.

6. Maintain a DONE list of everything you accomplished
7. Dress to be the person you aim to be. 
8. Watch your words. What you say shapes your reality. Words slip out in a moment but can cause everlasting damage. 
9. Pause. Slow Down. Take a Deep Breath. There is a lot of power in not reacting immediately.

> 	“Never explain — your friends do not need it, and your enemies will not believe you anyway.” –Elbert Hubbard


 9. Apologize when it matters, not as a reflex or because you want to pass on the emotional labor to the person you wronged. 
 
 Case 1. You actually something wrong. 
 Apologize as soon and precisley as possble. Take responsibility, learn, communicate and move on. 
 
Case 2. 
It also makes you needlessly supplicant. There's a better way to engage with people. A compassionate sense collective sense of 'we are all in this together,' and responsibility (but not shame) that you fucked up. Rather than one rooted in blame and guilt detached from reality. Life happens. There isn't enough space on the subway. It isn't your fault. Rather than apologize, laugh. Thank someone for their patience if you are late. Ideally, don't be late. 


10. Sleep. When you don't know what to do next, you probably need to sleep. Before you get all "grindset' and cut down on sleep, eliminate everything stopping you from sleeping that you shouldn't. Especially [sleep procrastination]. You aren't even close to the point where sleeping less would make you more productive. Get the lower-hanging fruit. Workout are better, writing is better, you are happier, healthier, more creative, and open to enjoy the incredible people you are so lucky to be around. 

In the [wise words of John Mulaney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiqKK4ysI7g):
> "Do all my friends hate me or do I just need to sleep?"

11. Clear space leads to a clear mind. Create systems of order in the few things you own. 

12.  Community underlies you and you it. If you can forget your radical dependence on others, it is a function of invisible work veiled by unrecognized privilege. I call facile metaphysical individualism. It truly takes a village to raise a child, and being raised and raising others is an integral human experience. Helping others meet their needs when yours are met is a gift. Asking others to help you meet your needs (when theirs are met) is also a gift. Get better at giving help and asking for it. The only way to recognize this is to do it. Not philosophize about it (too much! - see rule 15)

13. Lift HEAVY. Sometimes you need a challenging workout that involves lifting heavy shit — especially when you're spinning your wheels mentally. Testosterone comes from winning, and there is nothing like squatting heavy. 

14. Dance. Preferably with other people. But alone too!

15. Never let intellectualism win over humanism. Read philosophy, experience art of all kinds, participate in culture, create technology and not to adopt the detached, disembodied, "objective" critic nor develop into that disillusioned cynic. The hypertrophy of the intellect devours the soul. 
16. We all know people who feel tortured by how "smart" they are. Thats bullshit. For the most part, as far as I can tell, it's rooted in a weird, guilt-ridden performative value hierarchy things are valued in direct proportion to the "suffering" needed to attain them. At best an ok value hierarchy for work, but an utterly terrible one for connecting with other humans.
