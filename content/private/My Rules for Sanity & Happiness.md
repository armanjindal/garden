I've had a fraught relationship with rules. Please interpret them as MY rules for MY life. Please interpret the 2nd person pronouns as  

> "I trust that none will _stretch the seams_ in putting on the _coat_, for it may do good service to him whom it fits."


1. Work out and breathe fresh air every day. Lift, run, swim, climb mountains, fight, and stretch. 

2. Care for and love your body. It is your only true home and the only thing you always have. "Spend not one more second hating it." Nurture it. Be thankful for its function because the one thing you can know for sure is that it will deteriorate. 
3. Plan your day. Not in a way you are bound by it, but as a day you want to have. Plan to the degree that you do not need to bring your phone with you during the day.  Remove optionality to life not exist in possibility. 
4. Maintain a DONE list of everything you accomplished. 
5. Dress to be the person you aim to be. 
7. Watch your words. What you say shapes your reality. Words slip out in a moment but can cause everlasting damage. 
8. Pause. Slow Down. Take a Deep Breath. There is a lot of power in not reacting immediately.

 9. Apologize when it matters and not because you want to pass on the emotional labor of guilt to the other person. Not only does it put them in an awkward position, but it also makes you supplicant. There's a better way to engage with people. A compassionate sense collective sense of 'we are all in this together,' rather than one rooted in blame and guilt detached from reality. Life happens. There isn't enough space on the subway. It isn't your fault. Rather than apologize, laugh. Thank someone for their patience if you are late. Ideally don't be late. 


10. Sleep. You probably need to sleep when you don't know what to do next. Before you get all "grindset' and cut down on sleep, eliminate everything stopping you from sleeping that you shouldn't. Especially [sleep procrastination]. You aren't even close to the point where sleeping less would make you more productive. Get the lower-hanging fruit. BE DISCIPLINED ABOUT WORKING OUT EVERYDAY AND SLEEPING ON TIME. You are happier, more creative and open when you've slept. 

11. Clear space leads to a clear mind. Create systems of order in the few things you own. 

12.  Community underlies you. You are dependent on others and others on you. If you forget that, its only because you are immensely privalleged that your support system is invisible. 

13. Lift something HEAVY. Sometimes you need a hard workout — especially when you're spinning your wheels mentally.

14. Dance. Preferably with other people. But alone too!

And finally the last rule which ends every list of rules, straight from Orwell  

15. "Break any of these rules sooner than say \[or do!] anything outright barbarous."
