Hello, you! üëã

Welcome to my hyper-text garden ü™¥ 

This is not a blog or *personal site*. It is a self-indulgent, growing mass of interconnected notes. Peruse at your peril (or leisure!). See [the metaphor of the garden](digital-garden/meta/The-Garden-Metaphor.md) for more meta behind this Sisyphean endeavor!

This is what I am up to [now](digital-garden/now.md) and the [tools](digital-garden/Tools.md) I use.

## üßê Who am I?

I am a programmer, writer, humanist-technologist, (primal) mover, and friendly human! 

Philosophical qualifying: 

We answer the question of identity in some form every day. The modern human is thrown into a condition of constantly explaining ourselves to others. This can be wonderful. It can also sometimes feel terribly oppressive. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=70&v=fR5-x7v7UkE&feature=youtu.be) scene from [Sense8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense8) captures the innocuous poignance of that question. 

Click on my [me](digital-garden/meta/me.md) page for the longer story.  I'd ‚ù§Ô∏è to [connect](https://armanjindal.github.io/#-connect) and hear yours.
