Hello, you! üëã

Welcome to my hyper-text garden ü™¥ 

This is not a blog or *personal site*. It is a growing mass of interconnected notes to peruse at your leisure. See [the metaphor of the garden](digital-garden/meta/The-Garden-Metaphor.md) for more on this!

## üßê Who am I?

We answer this question in some form every day. The modern human is thrown into a condition where we constantly explain ourselves to the other. This can be wonderful, though sometimes it can be oppressive. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=70&v=fR5-x7v7UkE&feature=youtu.be) scene from [Sense8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense8) captures the innocuous poignance of that question. Philosophical qualifying aside. 

I am a programmer, writer, humanist-technologist, (primal) mover, and friendly human!
