##  🌊 Welcome 

Hello, you! Welcome to my garden 🪴

Here, you will find what I'm thinking, reading, writing, and doing. Check out my [now](digital-garden/personal/now.md) page for up-to-date information. This is not a blog. You can read more about what it is and the *meta*(phor) [below](https://armanjindal.github.io/#-the-garden-metaphor). Click around to get started. Ctr/Cmd + K to search by text.

Here is a growing list of [questions](digital-garden/personal/Questions.md) that I have. These are the [tools](digital-garden/personal/Tools.md) I use. 

## 🧐 Who Am I?

Perhaps the most philosophically loaded question we answer every day. Identity. Its poignance is captured in one of [my favorite scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=70&v=fR5-x7v7UkE&feature=youtu.be) from [Sense8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense8).

I am a writer, programmer, and builder. For more details check out my [me](digital-garden/personal/me.md) page!
## 🪴 The Garden Metaphor 

Maggie Appleton defines the digital garden in [A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

The metaphor of "garden" is much richer.

Gardens are primordially, a place of *creation*. Unlike blogs which are comprised of distinct, complete, organized writing, gardens are more chaotic. Comprised of a growing network of notes, they are responding to the environment. Like the act of *physically* gardening, writing is radically incremental. **It isn't heroic or final.**  One is never *done* working on their garden. That would be ridiculous. 

I hope to make *alive* as I live and write in it. The best gardens have "life" ([Timeless Way of Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building)). Call it vibes, a feeling, energy, juju: life is that intangible but real quality in people, places, and things. "Life" emerges at an untraceable point. Its presence isn't always recognized but its absence is. 

Most of my pieces are *saplings.* Expect some typos, incomplete sentences, and notes with little structure. The writing here isn't my considered "final" opinion. In fact, I expect over the course of my life, most pages will die. This is good. 

Ideas are helpful insofar as they lead to **life**: action, community, flourishing, and further questions. "Bad ideas" are anything that distracts the energy and attention that the best ideas demand. I am the measure of"good" and "bad" and I will change over time. Exposing my thoughts on the page as clearly as possible will help me test theory against *reality*, unafraid to modify, discard, and eradicate the bad.

I haven't started this garden to be *right*. It is a place for me to work in public, build a second brain, and write. It's a long-term project to reap the compounding benefits of knowledge, form and find community, and a platform to for self-expression without the evils of social media. 

Through consistent *gardening*, I hope to plant a few solid trees, nourished by the sunlight and the scrutiny of my readers. In the face of the confusing, contingent, and cruelly indifferent world Voltaire offers a compelling response. The pithy concluding line of *Candide*:

> [ "Il faut cultiver notre jardin."](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/)  

This garden — the few thoughts, ideas, books, and media I've decided to care about — is my response to an overwhelming infinity of information, suffering, and possibility. It's my earnest love letter to ideas:
- Life is best lived by embracing its limits 
- Perfect is the enemy of the good 
- The [unreasonable effectiveness of showing up every day](https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/)
- Creativity comes from being unabashedly unoriginal and [stealing like an artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_Like_an_Artist). 

It is a living polemic against finality. Cultivating this garden affirms my limited agency, and through it, I seek to share what I find beautiful, inspiring, and engaging with people in my life. 

The writing here, the plants growing in this garden, are not isolated, but neither are they neatly connected. They are in a "soil" connected by a tangled mass of roots — a rhizome. Tracing the genealogy of my thinking over time is a fascinating project in self-examination. This is a project I will support to the end of the internet. 

I chose an opinionated, open-source stack to build this site to support this lofty goal. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write — a [power user native](digital-garden/technology/Independent%20Study/Power%20&%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md), markdown note editor.  I publish this site using an open-source tool built by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) called [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz#quartz), which compiles the `markdown` files in my local Obsidian vault into a static HTML site. All pages are versioned on [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/commit/hugo), so there is a permanent, timestamped, line-by-line record of every change. I hope to look back at the commit histories to understand how my thinking changed. These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts, which ultimately help me shape, affirm, and faithfully **live** a narrative I've shaped.
