##  üåä Welcome 

Hello, you! Welcome to my garden ü™¥

Here, you will find writing on what I've thought, built, and done. This is what I am up to [now](digital-garden/now.md).  This "garden" is, decidedly, not a blog. Scroll down to get started, and for more on the [*meta*(phor) of the *garden*](https://armanjindal.github.io/#-the-garden-metaphor),  [me](digital-garden/me.md), and to [connect](https://armanjindal.github.io/#-connect)

This is a growing list of [questions](digital-garden/Questions.md) I have and a (hopefully shrinking!) list of the [tools](digital-garden/Tools.md) I use. 

## üßê Who Am I?

Identity. It's one of the most philosophically loaded questions we answer every day. The poignance and complexity of this question are captured in one of [my favorite scenes from television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=70&v=fR5-x7v7UkE&feature=youtu.be) in one of my favorite shows, [Sense8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense8).

I am a programmer, writer, [mover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpjVJbGMxaE), and builder. Check out my [me](digital-garden/me.md) page for the longer story. 

## ü™¥ The Garden Metaphor 

> [ "Il faut cultiver notre jardin."](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/)  
> ‚Äî Voltaire, the final line of [Candide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide)

Maggie Appleton defines the digital garden in [A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organized by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory ‚Äì notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

The metaphor of "garden" is much richer.

Gardens are primordially, a place of *creation*. Unlike blogs which are comprised of distinct, complete, organized writing, gardens are more chaotic. Comprised of a growing network of notes, they are responding to the environment. Like the act of *physically* gardening, writing is radically incremental. **It isn't heroic or final.**  One is never *done* working on their garden. That would be ridiculous. 

By gardening here I hope to bring these pages *alive*. The best places have "life" ([Timeless Way of Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building)). Call it vibes, a feeling, energy, juju: life is that intangible but real quality in people, places, and things. "Life" emerges at an untraceable point. Its presence isn't always recognized but its absence is. 

Most of my pieces are *saplings.* Expect some typos, incomplete sentences, and notes with little structure. The writing here isn't my considered "final" opinion. In fact, I expect over the course of my life, most pages will die. This is good. 

Ideas are helpful insofar as they lead to **life**: action, community, flourishing, and further questions. "Bad ideas" are anything that distracts the energy and attention the "best ideas" demand. I am the measure of"good" and "bad" and I will change over time. Exposing my thoughts on the page as clearly as possible will help me test theory against *reality*, unafraid to modify, discard, and eradicate the bad.

I haven't started this garden to be *right*. It is a place for me to work in public, build a second brain, and write. It's a long-term project to reap the compounding benefits of knowledge, form and find community, and a platform for self-expression without the evils of social media. 

Through consistent *gardening*, I hope to plant a few solid trees, nourished by the sunlight and the scrutiny of my readers. Which ground me in an overwhelming, confusing, contingent, and cruelly indifferent world. This garden ‚Äî¬†the few thoughts, ideas, books, and media I've decided to care about ‚Äî¬†is my response to an infinity of complexity, suffering, and possibility. It's my earnest love letter to ideas: 
1. Of the [limit embracing life](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/the-imperfectionist)
2. [Perfect is the enemy of the good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good) 
3. The [unreasonable effectiveness of showing up every day](https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/)
4. Creativity by unabashedly [stealing like an artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_Like_an_Artist)

The writing here, the plants growing in this garden, are not isolated, but neither are they neatly connected. They are in a "soil" connected by a tangled mass of roots ‚Äî a rhizome. Tracing the genealogy of my thinking over time is a project in self-examination. 

I chose an opinionated, open-source stack to build this site to support this lofty goal. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî a [power user native](digital-garden/technology/Independent%20Study/Power%20&%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md), markdown note editor.  I publish this site using an open-source tool built by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) called [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz#quartz), which compiles the `markdown` files in my local Obsidian vault into a static HTML site. All pages are versioned on [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/commit/hugo), so there is a permanent, timestamped, line-by-line record of every change. I hope to revisit the commit histories to understand how my thinking changed. 

With these tools, writing here helps me produce an expanding network of thoughts to help me shape, affirm, and **live** a narrative I've shaped.
