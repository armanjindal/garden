Occupying nearly the entirety of New York's iconic Guggenheim, the exhibition *Gego: Measuring Infinity* (March 31st to September 10th, 2023) is a major retrospective of the works of artist Gertrud Louise Goldschmidt (1912 – 1994), known as Gego. It's stated aim is to “make clear the development of German-Venezualens artist’s unique language of abstraction across various mediums, including sculpture, drawing, prints, artist’s books, and textiles.” (pg 11) 

In this exhibition critique I argue that the curators, Pablo León de la Barra and Geaninne Gutiérrez-Guimarães, effectivley utilize the Guggenhiem's architecture to craft a compelling,  narrative of Gego's artistic development, centered around her most notable style of reticulare. Rotunda by rotunda, we get a glimpse into Gego's development and ideas that lead to her iconic netlike, undulating, surfaes. Though they convince us of the artistist intent of Measuring Infinity, their curatorial efforts, in particular through repetition, overhead light, and movement, helps its viewers Imagine Infinity — a primordial spiritual, mathematical, philosophical, and political concept that Gego dedicated her life to exploring. This synthesis of curatorial and artist intent creates a tangible electricity and excitment for layperson and expert alike, a rarity for modern art. 

* Knowing full well that “audiences in the United States have had little opportunity to see and experience [Gego’s work] in depth, " the exhibit curators take full control of the frame through which viewers experience Gego. 
- The routunda structure enforces both order and movement through the exhibition. 
- Each rotunda is centered around both a concept/theme and a period and narrates a periodized chronological development. 
-  On walking up the first ramp,viewers are greeted with a short introduction to the exhibit. Here the curators give us a sense of the aims of the exhibit and a biographical sketch. However, though they promise a chronology they break it immediately. The viewer is thrown in, *en media res*, into a tall two storied room, known as the High Gallery with towering forms of Gego's iconic, wire sculptures in her most notable style Reticulárea. 
- Reticulárea is a style of sculpture, where thin wires are connected often to create rectangles or triangles and themselves assembled in a net-like structure. There is a local repitition but the small twists and changes ultimatley create different shapes.  
-   By throwing us into the climax of her style not only viewers were hooked (this was the prime selfie real-estate), they were also curious as to how these sculptures — wiry, geometric, abstract, gravity defying — came to be. Described by Gego as “drawing without paper” the style uses minimal lines to carve up and shape space. Viewers framing is shaped immediatley by this example "non-objective art." Art which uses geometric abstraction not as a means to represent objects in the world but as an exploration of geometric forms for its own sake. The high gallery as framing device is crucial. Both as a means to draw viewer into the narrative, but also to understanding “unique language of abstraction” Gego is developing. The curators then guide us on Gego's artistic journey to and beyond reticulárea.

-  The first rotunda, "*Early Works* (1953–60)", largely historic in its function, shows a number of prints and paintings flat along the wall starkly contrast the Reticulárea dimensionality of the sculptures in the previous room. A watercolor landscape painting of the Caracas mountain line, prints of [...], and an abstract painting of a house. We get a clear sense of how Gogo’s early works are informed by her training as an engineer and architect and how her sense of place and home is shaped as an immigrant to Venezuela, fleeing Nazi-Germany. These two concepts of mathematics and politics, as I will argue later, are important to her concept of Infitnity and role in imagining it. 
    
-  The second rotunda, "*Parralel Lines* shows a clear turn from abstracion to geometric abstraction and to metallic sculpture. The materiality not only are rebuke to gendered norms around sculpture and material, but also a nod to the rapid industrialization of Venezuela.Through parallel lines, negative space, and a moving viewer, Gego creates the optical illusion of movement. Kinetic art, artworks which have an element of movement perceivable to the viewer, are animated by the viewer's movement up the rotunda. Gego's work continue to be Kinetic and the source of the movement continues to remain with the biewer but as I will argue, it becomes more psychological and less physical with Reticulares.

* Finally on the fourth rotunda,  "Chorros, Troncos, and Esferas"(199)

-   Leaving the exhibition viewer when they finally reach the fourth rotunda, looking at the same sculpture’s that greeted them through a different lens .Repetition creates a conceptual familiarity. That familiarity invites viewers to look more closely. 
-   The benefit of this chronological framing, is we get a sense of the time and decades she spent meditating on Reticulárea through different media and in different forms. We get to see someone develop a language of abstraction, and the repetition of viewing slightly similar but different art helps to look at it more closely. We are now ready, to Imagine Infinity. To elucide how and why, I will use two pieces of art.

Finally at the fourth rotunda, do we see the move from parallel lines to reticular, 

  

-   The material is not longer solid, but aluminum. These interwoven nets.
    

  

Here the combination of the order, repetition of ideas in different forms and media, and development of concepts are ready to imagine infinity. Two artworks in particular help us get to what I believe is a deeply concerned, vastly interesting concept of infinity.

Imaging Infinity: 

-   It is our mind that must expand the space. Though it is not explicit, her meditation on abstraction through geometric form is fascinating. 
    
-   Asks us to conceptualize infinity as an endless process. However, while the endless-ness of the process is abstract, its start is grounded in the materiality of her surfaces. 
    
-   Lighting also serves to stimulate our imagination of another order of magnitude. 
    
-   The overhead lighting casts a strongly discernible shadow. The white walls of surfaces makes this projection — a mathematical term of a higher dimensional object rendered onto a lower dimension space — of a 3 dimensional object onto a 2-dimensional space, reminiscent of the mathematics of functions. A function as a mathematical is a mapping from one set to another. 
    
-   Uses of line, structure and light and shadow our imaginations of infitiniy are expanded. 
    
-   Perhaps, one of the coolest ideas from mathematics and the study of infinities is 
    
-   I left the exhibit thinking that no other museum and curation could present the works of Gego better.  
    
-   Meta-commentary — art as a surface upon which to stimulate and imagine our new societies. Infinity is a potent political concept, just as it is a religious one. The is an element of participation here, we must imagine even if the artists is manipulating materal. Modulation and undulation, associated with waves, are also associated with radio’s. A era defining technological shift. Her use of metals is no doubt a testament to the increasing industrialization and to rebuke gender norms, but also to the function of wires as conduits for electricity and the antenna like structures of radio singal towers.  
    

  - What tools are we using the Imagine Infinity? 
  
  -    reach the top, with a clear feeling that this exhibit was designed for this space.
