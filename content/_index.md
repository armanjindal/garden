#  üåä Welcome 

Hello, you! Welcome to my garden ü™¥ 

Here, you will find what I'm thinking, reading, writing, and doing. Decidedly this is not a blog. You can read more about the *meta*(phor) of my nook on the net beneath this.  

Here are some links to get started. You can also check out the graph view at the bottom, which shows backlinks. You can use the shortcut Ctr/Cmd + K to search by text (try it). The idea is to jump around with impunity. Don't feel obliged to finish. I'd much rather you get lost in a rabbit hole jumping around the inter web.

## ü™¥ The Garden Metaphor 

Digital gardens are nothing new. Maggie Appleton defines them in [A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory ‚Äì notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

While this is a good starting point, I believe the metaphor of "garden" is much richer.

Gardens have this primordial association as a place of *creation*. Unlike blogs which are comprised of distinct, complete, isolated, static, and organized entities, gardens are comprised of a growing network of plants. Thinking of writing as gardening helps me conceptualize the act of writing as a radically incremental one. It isn't heroic or final. You are never *done* working on their garden. That would be ridiculous. 

I hope that here you will find something *alive*. The best gardens have "life." Call it vibes, a feeling, energy, juju: it is that intangible but real feeling of aliveness we get from some places, people things that emerge at an untraceable point in their development. Interestingly its presence isn't always recognized but its absence is. 

To be clear, I know there isn't much of that here *yet*. This is early. Most of my pieces are *saplings.* Expect some typos, incomplete sentences, and notes with little structure. The writing here isn't my considered, "final" opinion. In fact, I expect over the course of my life most pages will die. This is good. Since ideas are helpful insofar as they lead to **life**: action, community, flourishing, and further questions. Bad ones are anything that distracts the energy and attention that the best ideas demand. These standards of "good" and "bad" are for me and will change over time. Exposing my thoughts on the page as clearly as possible will help me test theory against *reality*, unafraid to modify, discard, and eradicate the bad. 

I haven't started this garden to be *right*. It is an elaborate forcing mechanism to work in public, build a second brain, and write.  It's a long-term project to reap the compounding benefits of knowledge, form and find community, and a platform to express myself with greater control of the medium than social media. 

Through consistent *gardening*, I hope to plant a few solid trees, nourished by the sunlight and the scrutiny of my readers. In the face of the confusing, contingent, and cruelly indifferent world, I believe that Voltaire offers a compelling response in the pithy concluding line of *Candide*: 

> [ "Il faut cultiver notre jardin."](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/) 

Cultivating this garden constantly reminds me of the Voltairian wisdom to focus on the few things that matter, and to act on them daily. This garden ‚Äî¬†the few thoughts, ideas, books, and media I've decided to care about ‚Äî¬†is my response to an overwhelming infinity of information, suffering, and injustice.

This garden is a love letter to ideas that *perfect is the enemy of the good*, the *[unreasonable effectiveness of showing up every day](https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/)*, and the approach to creativity that begins with unabashed unoriginal work by [stealing like an artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_Like_an_Artist). It is a living polemic against finality, the static and passive. Cultivating this garden is an affirmation of my limited agency, and through it I seek to share what I find beautiful, inspiring, and interesting with people in my life. 

The writing here, the plants growing in this garden, are not isolated, but neither are they neatly connected. They exist in a soil rooted by a rhizome, a tangled mass of roots, chaotically connecting each piece. This is where the *wildness* comes from. I want to reveal to you the soil. w

I intend to write through connections, not isolation, with the meta-project of understanding the underlying patterns of thought, perspectives, and experiences that are changing what I call 'me.' My goal is to make connections between writing as explicit as possible: tracing the genealogy, connections, and changes to my writing over time is quite selfishly a fascinating project of self-examination.

I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack to build this site to support this lofty goal. Semi-obsessed with the fundamental, world and subject-shaping capacity of our tools, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî a [power user native](digital-garden/Independent%20Study/Power%20&%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md), personal knowledge management note editor with a graph view (bottom left) ‚Äî which is published on the internet through [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) ‚Äî an open source that converts Obsidian into a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator. All the pages are in `markdown` and versioned on GitHub, so there is a permanent, timestamped, line-by-line record of every change. I hope to look back at the commit histories to understand better how my thinking changes. These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts, which ultimately help me shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation. 


## üöÄ Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use it to write. 

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. You often need to review the code to merge a development branch into the main branch. This functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I aim to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write. 
3. (TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ü™¥


## üßê [Who Am I?](https://youtu.be/fR5-x7v7UkE?t=37) 

My name is Arman Jindal. I was born in Los Angeles, USA, and moved to Pune, India, when I was seven. I was educated in the [[International Baccalaureate]] program until I moved back to New York for University in 2018. I am in the final semester of my undergraduate at Columbia University, in the College, studying a combination track of Computer Science & Philosophy. I built my major through the CS department, joining several classes from philosophy, computer science, the history of science, and technology studies around a theme of  [Knowledge, Meaning & Computation](digital-garden/College%20-%20Knowledge%20and%20Computation.md). I updated my major every semester in response to changing interests and to study with the best professors.

I work as a peer writing fellow at the [Columbia University Writing Center](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/node/4083), where I work one-on-one with undergraduates and graduate students at Columbia for six hours a week, helping them in their writing process. I am not an authority but an attentive and curious reader who is invested in developing the writer in front of me best I can. Being a part of this incredible community of writers and teachers is one of the highlights of my undergraduate experience (shout out to the best bosses, Sue Medhelson and Jason, and my incredible friend who introduced me to this world Isabelle Pride.)

I graduate in May 2023 and want to build technology with incredible people at a place with a vibrant technical and mentorship culture. Professionally, I value "People, Ideas, and Things" in that order. I worked as a software engineer at [Airy](https://airy.co/), an open-source Berlin-based company over the summer of 2022. I am particularly passionate about working to bring about the political "reorientation of power and knowledge" that animated the early communities and programmers of free and open-source software. 

Please [get in touch](mailto:arman.jindal@columbia.edu) if you have an opportunity or want to chat. I can't promise much in return right now except enduring gratitude and that I will pay it forward through mentorship and advice when I'm further on in life and my career.

Personally, I enjoy dancing and working out(doors). I need to read, write and exercise every day. I open myself up to be moved by people, experiences, and art. I love to travel.  I've played [squash competitively] and [climbed a mountain](https://adventure-pulse.com/mountaineering/kang-yatse-2)in Leh (see below). Some of my heart is always in the Himalayas and underwater, with my family and inner circle of friends.  I meditate, move, converse, program and write. 

I am motivated by developing a [politics of programming](digital-garden/The-Political-Programmer.md) that seeks to understand the individual role and responsibilities of programmers and technologists today. We have a social and moral obligation to shape technology so that it increases our agency rather than diminishes it. Technology is developed by people and for people.
