title: "ü™¥ The Wild Garden"
---

Hello, you! Welcome to my garden ü™¥ 

Here, you will find what I'm thinking, reading, writing, and doing. Decidedly this is not a blog. I much prefer the metaphor of the garden. 

Gardens have this primordial association as a place of *creation*. Unlike, blogs which are comprised of complete and organized pieces of writing, gardens are an interdependent network of plants, at all stages of growth. 

The metaphor of the garden helps conceptualize writing as a radically incremental act of small improvements over time. Much like the act of *gardening*, it isn't heroic and it definitely isn't ever final. You are never *done* working on your garden. 

It is my hope that here you will find something *alive*. 

Right now, the garden is early, and most of my pieces are *saplings*. Which is to say many may die. This is good. Death is necessary for life. Ideas are helpful insofar as they lead to **life**. To action, community, flourishing, and further questions. I haven't started this garden to be *right*. I write as a daily practice to articulate theory in order to test it against *reality*, unafraid to modify or even outright destroy the ideas that diminish life. Through consistent *gardening*, I hope to seed solid oaks, nourished by the scrutiny of you, my readers, that ground me and provide shade to a few friends as we navigate life. 

In the face of the confusing, contingent, cruelly indifferent nature of our existence, I've found Candide's pithy concluding line comforting:

>  We must cultivate our own garden ("Il faut cultiver notre jardin.")
>  ‚Äî Voltaire [*Candide: ou l'Optimisme*](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/) 


Finitude, finality, and suffering are truths of our existence, which, when accepted, are no longer tormenting. In fact, they are liberating and the basis, in my opinion, of a good life. This garden is what I've decided to cultivate and care about in an infinity of possible options. 

Soil & Rhizome:
To extend this metaphor, possibly past its breaking point, I want to it to take the subterranean. The writing here ‚Äî the plants growing in this garden ‚Äî are not isolated, but neither are they neatly connected. There is a rhizome, a tangled mass of roots, that exists underneath the soil chaotically connecting each piece. 

There is nothing wrong with an orderly garden, but I prefer ones that are a bit *wild*. They grow around the environment, and the plants are connected unexpectedly. I intend to find and support seeing the connections that underly thought. My goal is to make connections between writing as explicit as possible. Tracing the genealogy, connections, and changes to my own writing over time is quite selfishly a fascinating project of self-examination.

To support this lofty goal, I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack to build this site. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî an open source, knowledge management text editor with a graph view (bottom left) ‚Äî that uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as a wrapper on the Hugo site generation. All of this is managed on GitHub, so there is a permanent record of every change. These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts rather than isolated ideas. All of which ultimately help me to shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation.

## Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use to write. 

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. To merge a development branch into the main branch, you often need to review the code. I think this functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I hope to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write. 
3. (TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ü™¥


#  Me
My name is Arman Jindal. I am currently a student at Columbia University, studying a joint program in Computer Science & Philosophy. I designed it around the question of [[Knowledge and Computation]]. 

I'm working as a part-time software engineer and technical writer for an open-source, Berlin-based start-up called Airy and as a peer fellow for the Columbia Writing Center.
