title: "ðŸª´ Arman's Wild, Open Source Garden"
---

Welcome, to my garden! ðŸª´ ðŸ‘‹  

A garden.  Not a blog. There are many differences you can read about [here](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). 

 My primary reason for this choice is the garden's (primordial) association as a place of *creation*. Over the years, I hope my nook on the internet comes to life.

You will find my writing at all stages, from rough outlines to polished pieces. Please enjoy them. Most are saplings and will likely die. This is good. Death is a necessary part of creation. If I am lucky and persistent, a few might seed into solid oaks: ones that ground me as I navigate the world's options and provide shade stay. 

This isn't just a garden, though. It's a *wild* garden.

There will be some unkempt areas. This is part of the charm. Right now, it is bare, and this will change.  However, it will never be too *orderly*. My go-to metaphor here is the [rhizome](https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/rhizome-deleuze-guattari/#:~:text=Rhizome%20is%20a%20philosophical%20term,They%20are%20dispersed.) â€” the central "mass of roots" that runs invisibly beneath the surface. Each piece is an idea that has roots that extend and branch, fertilizing the next, which may pop up unpredictably. 

I've designed the website to display the **connection** between notes using a graph view. These connections help me shape and live a narrative of my own creation.

My name is Arman Jindal. I am currently a student at Columbia University, studying Computer Science & Philosophy. I'm working as a software engineer for an open-source, Berlin-based start-up called Airy and as a peer fellow for the Columbia Writing Center. 

Here are some of the writing I am working on right now. (much [more to come](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues))

- Technology
	- [The Political Programming - Freedom, Open Source & Big Tech - From Walter Benjamin's Theory of Art & Artist](digital-garden/The-Political-Programmer.md) 

- Language 
	- [Language Matters!](digital-garden/Language%20Matters.md)
		- [Find Rhythm. Not Momentum](digital-garden/Rhythm-Not-Momentum.md)


## Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), a versioning protocol that allows large-scale collaboration on software.

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. To merge a development branch into the main branch, you often need to review the code. I think this functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I hope to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document and prioritize a million things I want to write. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is my friend here, and I will try to use it best to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ðŸª´
