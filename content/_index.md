Welcome, to my garden ðŸ‘‹ 

Yes. A garden.  Not a blog. There are [many differences](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). The most important one for me is the (primordial) metaphor of a garden as a place of *creation.* Through consistent care, I hope to bring my nook on the internet to life. 

Here you will find *polished* writing as well as rough outlines and notes. Most of my ideas at this phase of my life are saplings. Most will die, and this is good. Death is as much a part of creation as life. Some may provide a little shade to my friend and me. I need to write to stay sane. But I hope a few be the seed of the few oaks I hope to plant in my time here. For this to happen, they need sunshine and rain, neither of which my writing gets on my local disk. 

Like all truly wild gardens, there will be some unkempt areas. This is part of the charm.  Each page is a node in a network. Small ideas branch and connect unpredictably. My go-to metaphor here is not that of a tree but the [rhizome](https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/rhizome-deleuze-guattari/#:~:text=Rhizome%20is%20a%20philosophical%20term,They%20are%20dispersed.) - the main stem that runs beneath the ground horizontally coming from the ancient greek "mass of roots." Each sapling has roots that extend invisibly beneath the soil, fertilizing the next sapling which may pop up unpredictably. In a world overloaded with information, it is a connection that matters more. 

To create an experience like this, I have minimal starting links on my homepage but instead link to some throughlines from which you can explore related writing through the interactive graphs on the bottom right of each page.

Finally, although I maintain this garden, I hope to gather and integrate changes from a community that enjoys browsing and wants to add to its "life."  Right now, there will be friends and mentors who I will pester for feedback, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. 

Back to reality.  

My name is Arman Jindal. I am always a student, but currently, I am an official one. I am at Columbia university, joint-majoring in Computer Science & Philosophy.

To introduce myself, I'll link to some of the major throughlines at the moment

1. Open Source as a technique of work and future of technology.

2. The whole human (limits of science, reason) Body > Mind duality. 

3. Religion - the most ancient form of human psychology and anthropology. 

4. Technology - techne - man and machine. 

5. Language
