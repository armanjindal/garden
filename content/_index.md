title: "ðŸª´ Arman's Wild, Open Source Garden"
---

Welcome, to my garden! ðŸª´ ðŸ‘‹  

A garden.  Not a blog. There are many differences you can read about [here](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). 

 The primary reason I chose to call this a *garden* is its primordial association as a place of *creation*. 

I like to think of each piece of writing here as a plant. You will find plants at all stages of development, from rough outlines to polished pieces. Please enjoy them. Most are saplings, and most will die. This is good. Death is a necessary part of creation. If I constantly test theory against reality, unafraid to improve or even outright destroy the weeds, a few plants I seed now might flourish into solid oaks: ones that ground me as I navigate the world's options.

This isn't just a garden, though. It's a *wild* garden.

Connecting each plant is a [rhizome](https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/rhizome-deleuze-guattari/#:~:text=Rhizome%20is%20a%20philosophical%20term,They%20are%20dispersed.). A mass of roots slowly develops as each plant grows, forming an extensive underground network that can fertilize the next plant, which may pop up unpredictably. 

I chose a tech stack to build this website to support this lofty metaphor both in how I craft and how you consume the content on this website. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write (graph view below) and GitHub to version control. The tools will help me track my progress and draw out the connections. All of which ultimately helps me to shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation.

Here are some of the writing I am working on right now. (much [more to come](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues))

- On The Emancipatory Potential of Open Source: 
	- [The Political Programming - From Walter Benjamin's Theory of Art & Artist](digital-garden/The-Political-Programmer.md) 

- Islamic Philosophy & Mysticism
	- [The Physical World in Ibn Tufayl's Philosophical Tale](digital-garden/Tools/Ibn-Tufayl.md)

- Language, Cognition & Self
	- [Language Matters!](digital-garden/Language%20Matters.md)
		- [Find Rhythm. Not Momentum](digital-garden/Rhythm-Not-Momentum.md)

Through consistent gardening, over the years, I hope to bring to life my nook on the internet. 

## Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), a versioning protocol that allows large-scale collaboration on software.

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. To merge a development branch into the main branch, you often need to review the code. I think this functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I hope to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document and prioritize a million things I want to write. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is my friend here, and I will try to use it best to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ðŸª´
