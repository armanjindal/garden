Welcome, to my garden!  üëã  

Yes, this is [not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). 

  Gardens have a primordial association with *creation*, not completion. Each piece of writing here is a plant, and you will find plants at all stages. From rough outlines to polished pieces, it's here for you to see. However, please know that most "plants" are saplings that are still growing. Most may die over time, and this is good. 
  
  Death is a necessary part of creation. Ideas and concepts are helpful insofar are they lead to **life**. I am growing this garden to articulate myself as clearly as possible. Not to be **right** but to test *theory* against *reality*, unafraid to modify or even outright destroy the theory that does not lead to life. A few worthy "plants," nourished by the rain and sunshine, that grow under the scrutiny of readers, might flourish into solid oaks: ones that ground me in this crazy, incredible world. 

Because as captured in the pithy unadorned prose of [Voltaire's *Candide: ou l'Optimisme*](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/) the earnest protagonist Candide concludes, in the final line of the book after much suffering and tragedy, that in the face of it all:

>  We must cultivate our own garden ("Il faut cultiver notre jardin.")


This garden consists of the things I have decided to cultivate. The metaphor doesn't end with a garden, though. It's a *wild* garden.

Connecting each plant is a [rhizome](https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/rhizome-deleuze-guattari/#:~:text=Rhizome%20is%20a%20philosophical%20term,They%20are%20dispersed.): a network of roots that grows, fertilizing the soil, and connecting plants. In a nicely categorized world, I want this to be a place that mirrors how we actually think: by connection. 

To support this lofty goal, I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack to build this site. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî an open source, knowledge management text editor with a graph view (bottom left) ‚Äî that uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as a wrapper on the Hugo site generation. All of this is managed on GitHub, so there is a permanent record of every change. These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts rather than isolated ideas. All of which ultimately help me to shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation.

Please peruse as you would a garden ‚òÄÔ∏è To search by text you can use the shortcut (**Ctr/Cmd + K**). To traverse the connections, check out the graph view at the bottom.

Here are some pathways to help get you started.

## Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use to write. 

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. To merge a development branch into the main branch, you often need to review the code. I think this functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I hope to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write. 
3. (TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it best to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ü™¥


#  Me
My name is Arman Jindal. I am currently a student at Columbia University, studying a joint program in Computer Science & Philosophy. I designed it around the question of [[Knowledge and Computation]]. 

I'm working as a part-time software engineer and technical writer for an open-source, Berlin-based start-up called Airy and as a peer fellow for the Columbia Writing Center.
