title: "ü™¥ Arman's Wild, Open Source Garden"
---

Welcome, to my garden!  üëã  

Yes, a garden, not a blog. You can read about the many differences [here](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). 

I chose this metaphor for my digital home because of the garden's primordial association as a place of *creation*. [Language Matters](digital-garden/Language%20Matters.md), and here I think of each piece of writing as a plant. You will find plants at all stages in this garden. From rough outlines to polished pieces, I hope you enjoy them, but know that most are saplings, and most will die. This is good. Death is a necessary part of creation. I am constantly testing theory against reality, unafraid to modify or even outright destroy ideas that don't lead to life. A few worthy "plants," under the nourishment of rain and sunshine that withstand the test of open, might flourish into solid oaks: ones that ground me in this crazy, incredible world. 

Through consistent gardening, I hope to bring to life my nook on the internet. Since, as poignantly expressed in the final line [Voltaire's *Candide: ou l'Optimisme*](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/)

>  We must cultivate our own garden ("Il faut cultiver notre jardin.")


This isn't just a garden, though. It's a *wild* garden.

Connecting each plant is a [rhizome](https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/rhizome-deleuze-guattari/#:~:text=Rhizome%20is%20a%20philosophical%20term,They%20are%20dispersed.): a mass of underground roots that with each plant grows, fertilizing the soil for the next plant, which may pop up unpredictably. In a nicely categorized world, I want to find connections. 

To support this lofty goal, I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack for my rhizomatic garden. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî an open source, knowledge management text editor with a graph view (bottom left) ‚Äî embbed in [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as a site generation, managed on GitHub. These tools help conceptualize my works as an expanding network of connections rather than isolated writings. All of which ultimately help me to shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation.

Here are some of the starting points in my writing, but please peruse as you would a garden ‚òÄÔ∏è

## Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use to write. 

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. To merge a development branch into the main branch, you often need to review the code. I think this functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I hope to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write. 
3. (TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it best to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ü™¥


#  Me
My name is Arman Jindal. I am currently a student at Columbia University, studying a joint program in Computer Science & Philosophy. I designed it around the question of [[Knowledge and Computation]]. 

I'm working as a part-time software engineer and technical writer for an open-source, Berlin-based start-up called Airy and as a peer fellow for the Columbia Writing Center.
