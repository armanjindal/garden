title: "ü™¥ The Wild Garden"
---

Hello, you! Welcome to my garden ü™¥ 

Here, you will find what I'm thinking, reading, writing, and doing. Decidedly this is not a blog. I much prefer the metaphor of the garden. 

Gardens have this primordial association as a place of *creation*. Unlike blogs which are comprised of distinct, complete, isolated and organized entities, gardens are comprised of a network of plants at all stages of growth. 

The metaphor of the garden helps me view my daily writing practice as a radically incremental act ‚Äî much like *gardening*. It isn't heroic or final. You are never *done* working on your garden. That intangible but very real quality of "life" we feel in places, people, and things emerge at some untraceable point in its development. Just as you cannot specify exactly what point one is bald or ceases to be, similarly as a garden develops, you can't to the moment where life begins or ceases. 

I hope that here you will find something *alive*. 

 I don't think there's life here ‚Äî *yet*. The garden is early, and most of my pieces are *saplings*. In fact, most saplings will die. This is good. Death is necessary for life. Ideas are helpful insofar as they lead to **life**: to action, community, flourishing, and further questions. I haven't started this garden to be *right*. I write as to force myself to articulate my thought and stupidity on the page as clearly as possible. To theory to test it against *reality*, unafraid to modify or even outright destroy the ideas that diminish life. Through consistent *gardening*, I hope to seed solid oaks, nourished by the scrutiny of you, my readers, that ground me and provide shade to a few friends as we navigate life. 

In the face of the confusing, contingent, cruelly indifferent nature of our existence, I've found Candide's pithy concluding line comforting:

>  We must cultivate our own garden ("Il faut cultiver notre jardin.")
>  ‚Äî Voltaire [*Candide: ou l'Optimisme*](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/) 


Finitude, finality, and suffering are truths of our existence, which, when accepted, are no longer tormenting. In fact, they are liberating and the basis and form the basis of only a good life. Cultivating this garden constantly reminds me of the Voltairian widsom that the correct overwhelming infinity of information, suffering, injustice, and is to plant a garden and provide shade, a cold cup of water, and a smile to anyone who might come through.

**To the Soil & Rhizome ‚Äî Extending the metaphor to the subterranean.** 

The writing here, the plants growing in this garden, are not isolated but neither are they neatly connected. They exist in a soil rooted by a rhizome, a tangled mass of roots, that exists underneath the soil chaotically connecting each piece. 

There is nothing wrong with an orderly garden, but I prefer ones that are a bit *wild*. Plants grow around the environment and connect in seemingly unexpected ways. Writing has always been about well-organized isolated works that are final. This garden is a love letter to ideas that "perfect is the enemy of good", nothing here is final, and against the myth of originality. 

I intend to write through connections, not isolation, with the meta-project of understanding the underlying patterns of thought, perspectives, and experiences that drive my thinking and revision of it. My goal is to make connections between writing as explicit as possible. Tracing the genealogy, connections, and changes to my own writing over time is quite selfishly a fascinating project of self-examination.

To support this lofty goal, I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack to build this site. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî an open source, knowledge management text editor with a graph view (bottom left) ‚Äî that uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) ‚Äî an open source static site generator on top of Obsidian. Every change is tracked on GitHub, so there is a permanent, line-by-line record of every change to all my writing. I hope to look back at the commit histories to understand better how I think amidst constant change.  These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts rather than isolated ideas. I use these tools because they help me shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation.

## Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use to write. 

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. To merge a development branch into the main branch, you often need to review the code. I think this functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I hope to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write. 
3. (TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ü™¥


#  Me
My name is Arman Jindal. I am currently a student at Columbia University, studying a joint program in Computer Science & Philosophy. I designed it around the question of [[private/Knowledge and Computation]]. 

I'm working as a part-time software engineer and technical writer for an open-source, Berlin-based start-up called Airy and as a peer fellow for the Columbia Writing Center.
