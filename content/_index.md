title: "ðŸª´ Arman's Wild, Open Source Garden"
---

Welcome, to my garden ðŸ‘‹ 

Yes. A garden.  Not a blog. There are many differences you can read about [here](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), but honestly, I just love the (primordial) metaphor of a garden as a place of *creation.* Through consistent care, I hope to bring my nook on the internet to life. 

Here you will find complete writing as well as rough outlines and notes. Most of my ideas now are saplings. Most will die, and this is good. Death is as much a part of creation as life. Some may provide a little shade and maybe a few friends before dying of neglect. I hope a few though, over time will seed into the few oaks I hope to plant in my time here. For this to happen, they need sunshine and rain, neither of which my writing gets on my local disk, but may get too much of on the internet. 

This isn't just a garden, though. It's a *wild* garden.

There will be some unkempt areas. This is part of the charm.  I hope to have something that's more inhabitable soon, but it will never be orderly. My go-to metaphor for a piece of writing is not that of a tree or node but the [rhizome](https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/rhizome-deleuze-guattari/#:~:text=Rhizome%20is%20a%20philosophical%20term,They%20are%20dispersed.) - the main stem that runs beneath the ground horizontally. It's a word that comes from the ancient greek "mass of roots." Each note has roots that extend invisibly beneath the soil, fertilizing the next sapling, which may pop up unpredictably. In a world overloaded with information, it is about connecting it that matters. I hope this public place on the internet will help me do just that.  

To create an experience like this, I have minimal starting links on my homepage but instead link to some throughlines from which you can explore related writing through the interactive graphs on the bottom right of each page.

Finally, although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  Right now, there will be friends and mentors who I will pester for feedback, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is my friend here, and I will try to use it best to its full capacity. 

Back to reality.  

My name is Arman Jindal. I am currently a student at Columbia University, joint-majoring in Computer Science & Philosophy. I'm working as a software engineer for an open-source, Berlin-based start-up called Airy.

Here are some of the writing I am working on right now.
