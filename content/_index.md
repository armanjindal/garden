title: "ü™¥ The Wild Garden"
---

Welcome, to the garden!  üëã Here, you can find what I'm thinking, reading, writing, and doing.  Decidedly I am not calling this a blog. To start reading, scroll down to the next title. If you want to understand why I've called it a garden and the broader writing project, read on.

Gardens, unlike blogs, have a primordial association with *creation*. Blogs are polished pieces of writing that are complete and organized. Gardens, on the other hand, are *alive* ‚Äî comprised of plants. With this metaphor, writing becomes *gardening*, and the product of that gradual process is a growing plant. 

Right now, most of my pieces are *saplings*. They may slowly grow or die. This is good. Death is necessary for life. Ideas and concepts are helpful insofar as they lead to **life**. I haven't started this garden to be *right*. I write to share ideas that matter as clearly as possible in order to test theory *reality*, unafraid to modify or even outright destory the ideas that diminish life. Through consistent *gardening*, I hope to seed a few plants, nourished by the scrutiny of you, my readers, that flourish into solid oaks: ones that ground **us** as we navigate life. 

In the face of the confusing contingent nature of Life, which can often be cruelly indifferent to our attempts to control it, I've found Candide's retort in the final line of Voltair's short, popular tragic satire of the same name perfect. In the face of suffering, indifference and tragedy: 

>  We must cultivate our own garden ("Il faut cultiver notre jardin.")
>  ‚Äî Voltaire [*Candide: ou l'Optimisme*](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/cultivate-own-garden-voltaire/) 

This garden comprises the few things I have decided to care about. These things are growing and not isolated. They interact in exciting ways. 

There is nothing wrong with an orderly garden, but I prefer ones that are a bit *wild*. They grow around the environment, and the plants are connected in unexpected ways. I intend to find and support seeing the connections that underly thought. My goal is to make connections between writing as explicit as possible.  

To support this lofty goal, I chose an opinionated, open-source tech stack to build this site. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write ‚Äî an open source, knowledge management text editor with a graph view (bottom left) ‚Äî that uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as a wrapper on the Hugo site generation. All of this is managed on GitHub, so there is a permanent record of every change. These tools help me produce an expanding network of thoughts rather than isolated ideas. All of which ultimately helps me to shape, affirm and faithfully **live** a narrative of my creation.

## Community 
Although I maintain this garden, I hope to cultivate a community that enjoys browsing and adds to its "life."  To do this, I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io), which enables large-scale collaboration on software. Except I am going to use to write. 

Right now, there are two ways:
1. Feedback. To merge a development branch into the main branch, you often need to review the code. I think this functionality would work perfectly for writing. This has an added benefit that the hard work of the people who comment is transparently and immutably documented. 
2. [Issues](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io/issues). On the `Issues` tab of the GitHub repository on this site, I hope to scope/outline the writing I hope to publish. This is a great place to collect feedback (before I've even started to write), scope projects, track progress, document, and prioritize a million things I want to write. 
3. (TO COME) Milestones and corresponding branches to allow multiple projects to be developed in parallel. 

Right now, I expect it will be friends and mentors who I will pester to contribute, but I hope to have a broader audience of contributors as this grows. GitHub is immensely powerful, and I will try to use it best to "cultivate my garden" best I can. ü™¥


#  Me
My name is Arman Jindal. I am currently a student at Columbia University, studying a joint program in Computer Science & Philosophy. I designed it around the question of [[Knowledge and Computation]]. 

I'm working as a part-time software engineer and technical writer for an open-source, Berlin-based start-up called Airy and as a peer fellow for the Columbia Writing Center.
