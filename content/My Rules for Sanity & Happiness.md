I've had a fraught relationship with rules. Please interpret them as MY rules for MY life. Please interpret the 2nd person pronouns as  

> "I trust that none will _stretch the seams_ in putting on the _coat_, for it may do good service to him whom it fits."


- Work out and breathe fresh air every day. Lift, run, swim, climb mountains, fight, and stretch. 
- Take care of your body. It is your only true home and the only thing you always have. 
- Plan your day. Not in a way you are bound by it, but as a day you want to have. Plan to the degree that you do not need to bring your phone.  Remove optionality to life not exist in possibility. 
- Dress to be the person you aim to be. 
- Watch your words. What you say shapes your reality. Words slip out in a moment but can cause everlasting damage. Be careful who can hear you. 
- Pause. Slow Down. There is a lot of power in not reacting immediately. 
- Apologize when it matters and not because you want to pass on your guilt.  Pardon me" is a much less supplicant term. Life happens. There isn't enough space on the subway. If it isn't your fault. Even better, thank someone for their patience if you are late. It's the best you can. 
- Sleep enough.
- Clear space leads to a clear mind.
