I've had a fraught relationship with rules. Please interpret them as MY rules for MY life. Please interpret the 2nd person pronouns as  

> "I trust that none will _stretch the seams_ in putting on the _coat_, for it may do good service to him whom it fits."


- Work out and breath fresh air every day. Lift, run, swim, climb mountains, fight, and stretch. 
- Take care of your health. It is your home and the only thing you always have. 
- Plan your day, so that you have no need to bring your phone with you.  Remove optionality to be present and open to the world. 
- Dress to be the person you aim to be. 
- Watch your words. What you say shapes your reality.
- Pause. Slow Down. There is a lot of power in not reacting immediately. 
- Save your "I'm sorry" for when it matters. "Pardon me" is a much less supplicant term. Life happens. There isn't enough space on the subway. If it isn't your fault. 
- Sleep enough.
- Physical > Mental - Action leads to motivation. Clear space leads to a clear mind.
