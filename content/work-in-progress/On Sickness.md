Falling sick is like taking a shit. We all do it. We don't talk about it. We sequester those kinds of things to the bathroom (or hospital)

Though the former is well discussed especially among my sisters and their friends who went to boarding school, the taboo of the sickness and our lack  consequences of a former 

That ego which tells us, that we aren't going to get run over, or shot when, its a survival 

Facing up to the shared limits of our physical, base existence is something we've never liked to do. 

- In my head there is small sense of superiority when you haven't "fallen" sick. 
- Cultural mythology around a disease changes how we treat

- I just recovered from 
- Metaphor, 
- What if 


- When we are ill we are intimately aware of our finitude, mortality and feebleness to control what happens in the world. 
	- What if we always treat ourselves as if we are sick? Ill with the human condition. Like the patient with cancer who does what they can when they can. 
	- Perhaps one of the reasons of the medicalization of mental health is that for many its a label to treat themselves with the care and compassion of a person that is, under our society, sick. 
	- This is not an argument for or against the medicalization of mental health. But if some of the good of the label comes in that it facilitates self-compassion, perhaps that is a goal we can more directly strive to cultivate. 
	- Often a defense of neo-Freudian is that this story of maladapted chilhood patterns, which is not to say unimportant or unreal, deflates the power of blame. That so much of our daily lives and struggles are completely out of our control, and we need to recognize that.
