title: "Apartment Sublet - September - December/January, 2023"
---

I am subletting my room in a three bedroom apartment in 515 West, 110th Street. It is between Broadway and Amsterdam, a few mins walk from Columbia and right off the 1. The C train is a 8 min walk away, and the building, which is filled with Barnard/Columbia students, is between 

I LOVE this room and this apartment. I am looking for someone who will fit in here and enjoy living here. Ideally, it is for a whole semester. At minimum three months. Open to discuss an exact day and pro-rate accordingly. 

- It's a spacious, furnished room with an A/C and window. 
- The common space + kitchen are fully stocked. There is plenty of cupboard space and fridge space. We are a house of cookers, and often hosted dinner parties and all cooked together. 
- Excellent roommates. They are honestly so great its sad to leave even for a few months. 
- Very close to Columbia, a two min walk from 1 - 110th Street station and 7 min walk to the C.
- Private bathroom 

$1950/Month (not including utilities and WiFi)

It's a fully furnished with a private bathroom. There are three storage cupboards. I'll be taking one to keep my stuff.  Let me know if you're interested. I'll take this down when its filled.
