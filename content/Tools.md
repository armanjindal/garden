Here's a list of things I use. Tools are meant to enhance our powers of shaping the world. I am very much in the phase of trying and discarding. By keeping an explicit list, I interrogate if I need something. I think I need to use less, better. Finding tools which I am I going to use for a long time, which makes me a [power-user](digital-garden/Independent%20Study/Power%20&%20Power%20User%20-%20Prospectus.md) instead of a "passive." 

I love the engineering mindset of solving a once well, before moving onto the next. Dedicating the time to explore the thing
